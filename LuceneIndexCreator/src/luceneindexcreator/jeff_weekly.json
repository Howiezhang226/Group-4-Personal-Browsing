FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). \n\nIn addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. \n\nThat said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited \"appeals process\" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.\n\nFinally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.

Thus if the wording gets changed to \"who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation\" we have failed.\nPositive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.\n\n2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.\nRisk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.\n\nScott\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Stoness/HOU/EES on 07/03/2001 09:14 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nScott Stoness\n07/03/2001 08:40 AM\nTo:\tHarry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc:\tDon Black, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES \nSubject:\tDraft Bond Legislation Language\n\nHarry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:\nImposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.\nThe commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery....\nThe commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.\nThe DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.\n\nAlthough we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:\nIBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs.\nSImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge.\nI am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause \"The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.\"\nDoes the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; or\nIs it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]\nIs it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001\n\nIf it is possible, we should advocate:\nRegarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:\nImposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.\nThe commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.\n\nAnd we should get a legal interpretation of  \"The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.\"  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.\n\nScott","To":["james.steffes@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com"],"cont_length":1068,"Week_number":"26","Date":"Thu, 5 Jul 2001 14:30:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<9512163.1075851631455.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Re: CA Bond Legislation Language"},{"content":"thanks for everything.  really 'ppreciate it, 'migo.   and please thank karen, too.  also, would you tell her that prentice and i are willing and able (we think) to help out in any way we can in putting the fireplace stuff together----i.e., anything that doesn't require real skill, like sticking tiles on the board.  just let us know.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\ntah-mo","To":["ttt@cpuc.ca.gov"],"cont_length":64,"Week_number":"26","Date":"Thu, 5 Jul 2001 15:09:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<17625849.1075851631478.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Thanks.

From today's Post.  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n**********************************************************************\nFinancial \nCalifornia Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks\nPeter Behr\n  \n07/06/2001 \nThe Washington Post \nFINAL \nPage E01 \nCopyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \nCalifornia officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. \nGov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. \n\"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,\" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. \"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.\" \nThe new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. \nYesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. \n\"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,\" Wagner told reporters. \"In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment.\" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. \nWagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. \nLast Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. \nWagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. \nWagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a \"joke\" that the parties might as well wear \"clown suits,\" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. \nBut he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. \nWagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. \nDavis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. \nCalifornia 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile \"spot market\" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. \nIn response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. \nThat's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. \nA new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a \"refund\" because the deals were reached \"under commercial duress,\" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. \nIndustry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. \"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,\" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. \nThe state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a \"just and reasonable\" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. \n\"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. \nThose polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room \"billions of dollars apart,\" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.","To":["ann.cohn@sce.com","kmccrea@sablaw.com","mkahl@ka-pow.com","jdasovic@enron.com","wbooth@booth-law.com","drothrock@camfg.com","smutny@iepa.com","brbarkovich@earthlink.net","dominic.dimare@calchamber.com","isenberg@hmot.com","jstewart@cmta.net","mdjoseph@adamsbroadwell.com","lga@mother.com","debinorton@aol.com","cra@calretailers.com","derek.naten@roche.com","vjw@cleanpower.org","john.redding@gene.ge.com","mflorio@turn.org"],"cont_length":947,"Week_number":"26","Date":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 14:24:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<6044761.1075851631770.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"May you be forced to spend eternity with David Lazarus....\n\nP.S.

Daschle's aides and party strategists say =\r\nthe Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, d=\r\nraw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation an=\r\nd alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' cha=\r\nrges that it has ignored the country's energy needs.

There are very few issues like that in politics.\"  De=\r\nmocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.=\r\n Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus=\r\nh is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R=\r\nepresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and =\r\ngas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w=\r\nith support from 70 Republicans.  \"When the Republican-controlled House sou=\r\nndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an=\r\n opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center,\" sa=\r\nid Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy=\r\n came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c=\r\nommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum =\r\nwage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth=\r\ner issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic=\r\ny first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican =\r\nissue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President =\r\nDick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th=\r\ne moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ=\r\ny needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden =\r\nto special interests.  \"The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce=\r\nnt end of public opinion on this,\" a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp=\r\noke on condition of anonymity, said this week. \"It's a loser every day for =\r\nthe Republicans.\"  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N=\r\new Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm=\r\nittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I=\r\nt will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in =\r\nMay.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex=\r\nt week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme=\r\nnt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin=\r\ng off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne=\r\nar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped =\r\ndefuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac=\r\nk its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain o=\r\nver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of =\r\nBush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte=\r\nrior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a=\r\nlso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants=\r\n that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati=\r\non and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor=\r\nt utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo=\r\nmy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi=\r\ns month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle =\r\nextra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ=\r\nicans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co=\r\nllins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc=\r\nCain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights=\r\n and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio=\r\nn measures than the White House proposes.  \"He'll be very prominent in cobb=\r\nling a centrist coalition on the issue,\" said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe=\r\nllow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a=\r\ndviser to McCain. \"You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc=\r\nouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment=\r\nally friendly.\"  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it=\r\ns energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend=\r\ning for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als=\r\no has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp=\r\nending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the=\r\n president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee=\r\nds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials=\r\n say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ=\r\ny plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas=\r\nkan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f=\r\nor research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr=\r\noval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t=\r\nhe sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin=\r\ng blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and =\r\nlast week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call=\r\n for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue =\r\nand attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui=\r\nck solutions.  \"It's a target of opportunity,\" said Burdett Loomis, a polit=\r\nical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Lik=\r\ne the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, e=\r\nnergy right now \"is low-hanging fruit,\" he said.  =09","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","james.steffes@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","mpalmer@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","janel.guerrero@enron.com","skean@enron.com"],"cont_length":1124,"Week_number":"26","Date":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 15:35:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<12794624.1075851631844.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Senate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues"},{"content":"You can send both, but I'd have folks keep it close to the vest.

The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.\n\nI'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:\n\nCustomers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. \n\nIn short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.\n\nCustomers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  \n\nFor example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.\n\nI believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.\n\nIn addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.\n\nFinally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?\n\nLook forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the \"core/noncore\" proposal.\n\nBest,\nJeff","To":["susan.mara@enron.com"],"cont_length":698,"Week_number":"26","Date":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 15:58:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<22454078.1075851631945.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Re: Bond Leg Language, etc."},{"content":"Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the \"core/noncore\" proposal in California.

These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. \n\"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources,\" Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.","To":["mikahl@ka-pow.com","brbarkovich@earthlink.net","vjw@cleanpower.org","cohnap@sce.com","fieldejr@sce.com","schoongl@sce.com","jdasovic@enron.com","drothrock@cmta.com","kmccrea@sablaw.com","dhunter@s-k-w.com"],"cont_length":330,"Week_number":"26","Date":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 20:59:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<23362657.1075851632298.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status."},{"content":"See you on Sunday with language on Direct Access.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n\t\"Delaney Hunter\" <dhunter@s-k-w.com> 07/06/2001 02:52 PM Please respond to dhunter \t   To: \"Mike Kahl (E-mail)\" <mikahl@ka-pow.com>, \"Barbara Barkovich (E-mail)\" <brbarkovich@earthlink.net>, \"John White (E-mail)\" <vjw@cleanpower.org>, \"Ann Cohn (E-mail)\" <cohnap@sce.com>, \"John Fielder (E-mail)\" <fieldejr@sce.com>, \"Gary Schoonyan (E-mail)\" <schoongl@sce.com>, \"Jeff Dasovich (E-mail)\" <jdasovic@enron.com>, \"Dorothy Rothrock (E-mail)\" <drothrock@cmta.com>, \"Keith McCrea (E-mail)\" <kmccrea@sablaw.com>  cc: \"Phil Isenberg (E-mail)\" <isenberg@hmot.com>  Subject: URGENT!

Note discussion of Ed, Enron and the 21st Century Energy Project at end of article.\nBest, Jeff\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCampaign funds will pay for spots \nRobert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau\nSaturday, July 7, 2001 \n?2001 San Francisco Chronicle \nSacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. \nDavis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an \"information void\" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. \n\"The campaign season has started early,\" said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19. \nDavis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an \"energy update,\" where the governor informs listeners that \"we\" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that \"conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices.\" \nDavis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed \"Flex Your Power\" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. \nSouth dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. \n\"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack,\" South said, \"is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood.\" \nStutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. \n\"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads,\" Stutzman said. \"The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue.\" \nDavis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show \"The West Wing.\" The Sheen photo dominates the home page. \n\"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it,\" said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President Bush in 2004. \nLast month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from \"Grayouts.\" \nTime magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of \"unconscionable price-gouging.\" \nReliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. \nScott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. \nEven though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. \nBut the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. \nDavis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. \nAnother conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. \nThe $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. \nGillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a \"conservative, market- oriented message\" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. \n\"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far,\" Gillespie said. \nE-mail Robert Salladay at rsalladay@sfchronicle.com. \n?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 6","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","skean@enron.com","mpalmer@enron.com","james.steffes@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com"],"cont_length":871,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Sun, 8 Jul 2001 14:25:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<5817988.1075851632471.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Campaign funds will pay for spots --Enron/Gillespie mentioned"},{"content":"Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.

The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).\n\nThere are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to \"talk to his boss\" because he \"didn't want to do anything wrong.\"  \n\nNote:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.\n\n\nTranscription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38\n\nEnron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].\n\nISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.\n\nEnron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?\n\nISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.\n\nUnknown:  Stage one at 11.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?\n\nEnron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Yeah.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].\n\nISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?\n\nISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?\n\nISO:  Allen:  Yes\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Um,?.\n\nISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?\n\nISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Okay, um?..\n\nISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?\n\nISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?\n\nISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back?.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   \n\nAllen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back?.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.\n\nISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?\n\nISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Shit.\n\nISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or ?.\n\nISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.\n\nISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.\n\nEnron:  Ryan: Okay.\n\nISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.\n\nTranscription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:46:55 - 14:47:40 (3 minutes later)\n\nEnron:  This is Ryan.\n\nISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Yeah.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?\n\nISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Oh, I didn't do 17, no.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Well, see, we're gonna run, we're gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Okay.\n\nISO:  Allen:  If you have any questions, let me know.  I hope you know this is me from the ISO.  I don't know if you think I'm somebody else but you can call me at the hour-ahead desk.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Well, I mean, I'm talking to my boss right now as far as, because of, you know, I don't want to be doing anything that's wrong.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Yeah? \n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Even if it is helping you guys out, if it's wrong, I can't do it.\n\nISO:  Allen:  I know, but if you continue to bid in at, um, the market, that's the best thing to do.  For replacement.  All right.\n\nEnron:  Ryan:  Okay, I'll see what I can do.\n\nISO:  Allen:  Thanks, man.","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","mpalmer@enron.com"],"cont_length":1147,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 17:19:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<17471897.1075851632665.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Re: Transcript of a bizarre and unusual telephone call from the ISO"},{"content":"----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 07/09/2001 02:23 PM -----\n\n\n\tJeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 07/09/2001 02:16 PM \t  To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron  cc:   Subject: Re: Please Take a Look--Draft Slides for Monday Talk in New York on California Crisis \t\n\n\nYes.

ideologues who are\r\n> insensitive\r\n> to the practical impacts on peoples' lives of high electricity prices.\r\n>   But the most common argument against price caps has been logical, not\r\n> ideological: Price controls have never worked.

The initial price cap rule, set by the California Independent\r\n> System\r\n> Operator last spring, was only a few paragraphs long.

And no=\r\nw\r\n> additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes.\r\n>   The revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the\r\n> June\r\n> order. During a spell of very hot weather Monday, Sierra Pacific Resource=\r\ns\r\n> (SRP)\r\n> subsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a\r\n> small\r\n> number of customers for 45 minutes. The company attributed the blackouts,\r\n> in\r\n> part, to the new price controls.\r\n>   Sierra Pacific's chief spokesman, Paul Heagen, provided a bird's eye\r\n> view of\r\n> the practical realities of the FERC's new price cap regime.\r\n>   Power Points: After having a few days to look into it, can you say that\r\n> price\r\n> caps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday?\r\n>   Paul Heagen: Yes, but first let me say that all of it was unintentional=\r\n.\r\n> FERC\r\n> was trying to do the right thing. Price caps were a noble effort to solve\r\n> a real\r\n> problem in California.\r\n>   But on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function. It had\r\n> neither,\r\n> and that can be attributed to the price caps. Normally, in one or two\r\n> phone\r\n> calls we could have got what we needed. On Monday, we were five to six\r\n> calls\r\n> into it and still on the phone.\r\n>   Price caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other\r\n> states into\r\n> the California morass. We have this artificial environment which we are\r\n> all\r\n> trying to sort through.\r\n>   PP: How, specifically, are the caps having this effect?\r\n>   PH: There are a couple of elements. The 10% premium for power sold to\r\n> California is supposed to reflect concerns about credit. That 10% in an\r\n> open\r\n> market is no big deal, but in a constrained situation the seller will gra=\r\nb\r\n> it,\r\n> because now it's his only chance to make money.\r\n>   Also, the way this is set up, they look backwards. They determine the\r\n> price\r\n> after the fact. I can't think of any business in the world where you sell\r\n> a\r\n> product and find out later what price you sold at.\r\n>   This had a very chilling effect on people's willingness to sell.\r\n> Normally, a\r\n> cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in th=\r\ne\r\n> real-time market. Normally, those little 50-megawatt packets move pretty\r\n> easily,\r\n> and that's really important for maintaining reliability.\r\n>   With the price cap, utilities hunkered down. Selling at $92 wasn't wort=\r\nh\r\n> the\r\n> risk. They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it.\r\n>   Also, we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share\r\n> savings\r\n> with customers who agree to curtail use. If the market is, say, $500, we\r\n> might\r\n> pay them $250/MWh to curtail demand. But in a $92/mkt, we can offer them\r\n> such a\r\n> small amount of money that they stay on.\r\n>   PP: Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price\r\n> controls?\r\n>   PH: We've had a senior team in Washington, D.C., at the FERC since last\r\n> week.\r\n> Right away we saw another effect of the FERC order: It penalizes companie=\r\ns\r\n> like\r\n> ours that signed long-term supply contracts before the order because many\r\n> of\r\n> those deals were done at prices above the price cap.\r\n>   The biggest issue for us, is, did FERC really mean to penalize companie=\r\ns\r\n> like\r\n> us that planned ahead? It's long-term contracts that provide price\r\n> stability.\r\n>   It's unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for long-term\r\n> contracts\r\n> that have been undercut by price caps. If we get into a situation where w=\r\ne\r\n> have\r\n> a little extra to sell, now we can't recover our costs.\r\n>   PP: With such high prices the past year, a lot of small, oil-fired\r\n> turbines\r\n> have been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer. Trader=\r\ns\r\n> for\r\n> other southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have\r\n> been\r\n> very helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year, but they weren'=\r\nt\r\n> available this week because they cost more to run than the price cap. Did\r\n> you\r\n> see the same thing?\r\n>   PH: We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe\r\n> area in\r\n> the last few months. They were supposed to provide peak power, but they\r\n> get\r\n> uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme.\r\n>   You know, we've tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the\r\n> California situation and behave very independent of how California\r\n> behaves.

For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.\n\nThey are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding \"spot market service\" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as \"an option to elect.\"  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a \"backstop,\" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.\n\nPlease take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any \"stakes in the ground\" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.\n\nIn addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., \"what to do about DA in the interm?\"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.\n\nFinally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.\n\nThanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).\n\nBest,\nJeff","To":["jeff.dasovich@enron.com","ann.cohn@sce.com","brbarkovich@earthlink.net","dhunter@s-k-w.com","dominic.dimare@calchamber.com","drothrock@cmta.net","fieldejr@sce.com","isenberg@hmot.com","jdasovic@enron.com","kmccrea@sablaw.com","lys@a-klaw.com","lysherif@yahoo.com","schoongl@sce.com","vjw@cleanpower.org"],"cont_length":362,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 20:13:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<29041037.1075851632955.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Re: REVISED Merged Leg Document"},{"content":"----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 07/09/2001 06:07 PM -----\n\n\n\t\"Delaney Hunter\" <dhunter@s-k-w.com> 07/09/2001 06:08 PM Please respond to dhunter \t   To: \"Jeff Dasovich (E-mail)\" <jdasovic@enron.com>  cc:   Subject: More on FERC generator hearings\t\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: McEvoy, Bridget [mailto:Bridget.McEvoy@ElPaso.com]\nBN  18:06 Talks Between California, Generators End; No Accord (Correct)\n\n(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to\n\nresult disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph\n\nand comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)\n\n \n\n     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two\n\nweeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power\n\nsellers to pay refunds in California and other western states\n\nrecommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold\n\nhearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.\n\n     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two\n\nsides no closer to an accord.\n\n     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,\nFERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far\n\napart.''\n\n      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because\n\nthe companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are\n\nalso requesting money.\n\n     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California\n\nduring the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of\n\ncalculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks\n\noffered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from\n\ngenerators to $716 million.\n\n      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how\n\nthe state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by\n\nCalifornia's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said\n\nWagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should\n\nbe paid.\n\n     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and\n\nshould calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price\n\ncaps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest\n\npriced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.\n\n      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,\n\nWagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a\n\nrefund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from\n\nthat time period.\n\n     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's\n\nrecommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would\n\ngive his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and\n\nCalifornia will sue to get the rest, he said.\n\n     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without\n\nreleasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.\n\n     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,\n\nthough they agreed the state asked for too much.\n\n    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to\n\njustify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because\n\nwe bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in\n\nquestion,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of\n\nthe power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows\n\nhow ridiculous this is.''\n\n    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund\n\n$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.\n\n     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a\n\nsettlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting\n\nblame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''\n\n     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's\n\nrecommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general\n\ncounsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes\n\nproblems with California's methodology for calculating the\n\nrefunds, he said.\n\n      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14\n\nbillion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when\n\nthe state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The\n\nstate began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and\n\nhas spent close to $8 billion.\n\n \n\n--Amy Strahan Butler and Jeff Bliss in Washington (202) 624-1975\n\nor jbliss@bloomberg.net and in Washington/mmw/alp/mmw\n\n\n\nBridget McEvoy\nInvestor Relations\nEl Paso Corp.\n713.420.5597\nBridget.McEvoy@elpaso.com\n\n\n\n******************************************************************\nThis email and any files transmitted with it from the ElPaso \nCorporation are confidential and intended solely for the \nuse of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed. \nIf you have received this email in error please notify the \nsender.\n******************************************************************","To":["alan.comnes@enron.com","angela.schwarz@enron.com","beverly.aden@enron.com","bill.votaw@enron.com","brenda.barreda@enron.com","carol.moffett@enron.com","cathy.corbin@enron.com","chris.foster@enron.com","christina.liscano@enron.com","craig.sutter@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","debora.whitehead@enron.com","dennis.benevides@enron.com","don.black@enron.com","dorothy.youngblood@enron.com","douglas.huth@enron.com","edward.sacks@enron.com","eric.melvin@enron.com","erika.dupre@enron.com","evan.hughes@enron.com","fran.deltoro@enron.com","gayle.muench@enron.com","ginger.dernehl@enron.com","gordon.savage@enron.com","harold.buchanan@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","iris.waser@enron.com","james.steffes@enron.com","james.lewis@enron.com","james.wright@enron.com","jeff.messina@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","jess.hewitt@enron.com","joe.hartsoe@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","kathy.bass@enron.com","kathy.dodgen@enron.com","ken.gustafson@enron.com","kevin.hughes@enron.com","leasa.lopez@enron.com","leticia.botello@enron.com","mark.muller@enron.com","marsha.suggs@enron.com","marty.sunde@enron.com","meredith.eggleston@enron.com","michael.etringer@enron.com","michael.mann@enron.com","michelle.cisneros@enron.com","mpalmer@enron.com","neil.bresnan@enron.com","neil.hong@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","paula.warren@enron.com","richard.zdunkewicz@enron.com","richard.leibert@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","rita.hennessy@enron.com","roger.yang@enron.com","rosalinda.tijerina@enron.com","sandra.mccubbin@enron.com","sarah.novosel@enron.com","scott.gahn@enron.com","scott.stoness@enron.com","sharon.dick@enron.com","skean@enron.com","tanya.leslie@enron.com","tasha.lair@enron.com","ted.murphy@enron.com","terri.greenlee@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","tony.spruiell@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","vladimir.gorny@enron.com","wanda.curry@enron.com","william.bradford@enron.com","kathryn.corbally@enron.com","jubran.whalan@enron.com","triley@enron.com","richard.sanders@enron.com","robert.williams@enron.com","greg.wolfe@enron.com","james.wright@enron.com","dirk.vanulden@enron.com","steve.walker@enron.com","jennifer.rudolph@enron.com","martin.wenzel@enron.com","douglas.condon@enron.com","wgang@enron.com","sgovenar@govadv.com","hgovenar@govadv.com","jklauber@llgm.com","mike.smith@enron.com","john.neslage@enron.com","janel.guerrero@enron.com","eric.letke@enron.com","richard.sanders@enron.com","gfergus@brobeck.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","robert.frank@enron.com","richard.sanders@enron.com","gfergus@brobeck.com","susan.mara@enron.com","chris.holmes@enron.com","david.leboe@enron.com","sgovenar@govadv.com","hgovenar@govadv.com"],"cont_length":721,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 21:10:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<9955395.1075851633006.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"More on FERC generator hearings"},{"content":"\"Sacramento or Salem?\"  Sort of has a nice ring to it.","To":["mpalmer@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com"],"cont_length":11,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 21:16:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<17929042.1075851633029.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"No intent to make people pay twice.

I think it is very interesting to consider in\nlight of the present energy situation in California and the comments of\nour present Governor.\n\nRegards,\nCurt\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n***Who Really Powers California?***\nGovernor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,\ncattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy\ncrisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the\nGovernor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers\nmay\nbe interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The\nfollowing list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each\ngroup of\ngenerators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded\nup\nresulting in slightly more than 100%)\n\n18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)\n15%- Southern California Edison (California)\n11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)\n10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)\n10%- Imported power from the Southwest\n7%- State and Federal Agencies\n6%- AES power company\n5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts\n5%- Reliant power company\n4%- Duke power company\n4%- Southern power company\n4%- Dynegy power company\n1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)\n1%- Calpine power company\n1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)\n \nIt should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from\nTexas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's\nenergy\nportfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's\nAES,\nand North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy\nportfolio.\n\nThis list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every\nprovider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to\nidentify those power producers who used market power to ring up high\nprofits\non Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our\ninvestigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power\ncompanies,\nutilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts\ncould\nall be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those\ncompanies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a\nmisrepresentation of fact.\n\n------------------------------\n\nCurt Pringle\nCurt Pringle & Assoc.\n2532 Dupont Drive\nIrvine, CA 92612\n\n(949) 474-4090\n(949) 474-4082 fax","To":["sgovenar@govadv.com","hgovenar@govadv.com"],"cont_length":436,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 12:23:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<4861471.1075851633273.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: where does our energy come from?"},{"content":"California; Metro Desk\nElectricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.\nRICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH\nTIMES STAFF WRITERS\n\n07/10/2001\nLos Angeles Times\nHome Edition\nB-1\nCopyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company\n\nSACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. \nDuring the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.\nAmong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. \nIn fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. \nThe figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. \nDavis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. \n\"You have to look at the whole picture,\" Maviglio said. \n\"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,\" he said. \"Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.\" \nThe report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. \nThe records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. \nOscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. \"All the prices were high,\" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. \nThe average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. \nIn the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. \nBy contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. \nA spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the \"vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts.\" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. \nA spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. \nMore Power Bought Than Projected \nHidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. \nStill, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. \nHidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. \nThe reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. \nA summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with \"moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.\"\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Gray Davis said he was heartened by the judge's belief that California=\r\n is due some amount of refund money, rejecting the generators' arguments fo=\r\nr no refunds.=20\r\nWith the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power t=\r\nraders had offered up $716 million in proposed refunds in the final days. B=\r\nut Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state st=\r\nill owes power companies, meaning no cash would actually change hands.=20\r\nThe judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San=\r\n Jose-based Calpine Corp., could reach separate agreements with the state.=\r\n=20\r\n\"From what I know, it looks like we can reach an agreement,\" Calpine spokes=\r\nman Bill Highlander confirmed Monday. But he said he could not disclose any=\r\n details under Wagner's gag order on participants in the negotiations.=20\r\nEnron Corp., one of the nation's highest-profile power traders, said Califo=\r\nrnia officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the=\r\n state's consumers deserved at least $8.9 billion in refunds for overcharge=\r\ns.=20\r\n\"These talks never had a chance,\" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. \"Their =\r\npolitical skins are worth more than $716 million that the taxpayers of Cali=\r\nfornia could have used. It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a =\r\nwitch hunt.\"=20\r\nOf the $716 million compromise offer, $510 million was put on the table by =\r\nwhat Wagner called the \"Big Five\" generators -- Reliant, Duke, Mirant, Will=\r\niams and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation. Another $125=\r\n million was offered by BC Hydro, British Colombia's government utility, wh=\r\nich is not under FERC jurisdiction, and $16.5 million was offered by six Ca=\r\nlifornia municipal utilities.=20\r\nThe Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the state's second-largest munic=\r\nipal utility, also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amoun=\r\nt it may have offered, but said it would outline its position in writing Th=\r\nursday, the judge's deadline for comments on his proposal.=20\r\nConsumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge's brief publi=\r\nc remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on=\r\n the state's troubled electric scene.=20\r\n\"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's outra=\r\ngeous,\" said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. \"If they're g=\r\noing to start doing some fact finding, hallelujah.\"=20\r\nHoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start, because there was =\r\nno effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been a=\r\nnd then work toward a compromise from there.=20\r\nThe state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator, the Ind=\r\nependent System Operator, which was attacked by marketers as wildly high ev=\r\nen while the state called it conservatively low.=20\r\nJoel Newton, representing all five of the big generators, said Monday that =\r\nthe ISO has consistently based its demand on \"sketchy and incomplete\" data.=\r\n=20\r\nThe face-off between Davis and power merchants began last fall, as wholesal=\r\ne electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they =\r\ncould be driven into bankruptcy.=20\r\nThe governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state's powe=\r\nr shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers. Generators said they =\r\nfollowed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situati=\r\non.=20\r\nFERC, which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electr=\r\nicity rates are \"just and reasonable,\" has made repeated, unsuccessful effo=\r\nrts to craft a solution that could appease both sides.=20\r\nState Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said Monday that t=\r\nhe failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure \"comes as no=\r\n surprise.\"=20\r\nNegotiators representing generators \"refused to even acknowledge the inesca=\r\npable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional=\r\n market -- at California's expense,\" he said.=20\r\nDavis, who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith=\r\n with state representatives, said that although FERC commissioners have bee=\r\nn slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesa=\r\nle electricity, they \"now have the opportunity to redeem themselves.\"=20\r\nHe suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is rec=\r\nommended by the judge.=20\r\nWagner, after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend, seemed=\r\n resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government, utility=\r\n and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futilit=\r\ny.=20\r\nMichael Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the Calif=\r\nornia ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well.=\r\n=20\r\n\"We came here wanting $8.9 billion,\" Kahn said. \"In all candor, we didn't r=\r\neceive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as=\r\n helpful as we had hoped they would be. But our positions were vindicated\" =\r\nbecause refunds were offered.=20\r\nMeanwhile, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison soun=\r\nded the call for more talks.=20\r\n\"We're willing to talk to anyone, anytime about a settlement,\" said Steve P=\r\nickett, general counsel of Southern California Edison. PG&E said in a prepa=\r\nred statement that the sessions \"provide a solid basis for further negotiat=\r\nions.\"=20\r\nHow much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question =\r\nmark. Wagner said settlement offers of $716 million suggest that eventual r=\r\nefunds will amount to \"hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion.\" B=\r\nut he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC comm=\r\nissioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be.=20\r\nOther recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mi=\r\nxed bag for the state.=20\r\nThe judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct. 2, 2000=\r\n, an action that Kahn said would immediately slice $3 billion off the state=\r\n's refund analysis that stretched back to May 2000.=20\r\nBut Kahn said that was no defeat for the state, which would turn to the cou=\r\nrts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order.=\r\n=20\r\n\"We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder,\" Kahn said.=20\r\nBrent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy of North Am=\r\nerica, said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund =\r\norder in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20\r\n\"It's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks,\" Bailey=\r\n said.=20\r\n\r\nThe Bee's David Whitney can be reached at (202) 383-0004 or dwhitney@mcclat=\r\nchydc.com .=20\r\nStaff writers Emily Bazar and Dale Kasler contributed to this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird power plant opens: But the Los Medanos facility isn't pouring out ele=\r\nctricity yet.=20\r\nBy Carrie Peyton\r\nBee Staff Writer\r\n(Published July 10, 2001)=20\r\nThe flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov. Gray Davis was only a t=\r\nrickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on Monday, accord=\r\ning to sources close to California's energy crisis.=20\r\nHeralded by Davis as part of a \"powerful one-two-three punch\" that will bri=\r\nng California closer to energy independence, the Los Medanos Energy Center =\r\nin Pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day, they sa=\r\nid.=20\r\nThat is less than 5 percent of the plant's 555-megawatt operating capacity.=\r\n=20\r\nLos Medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week bu=\r\nt is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks, accordin=\r\ng to knowledgable sources.=20\r\nRepresentatives for Calpine and the governor's office, when pressed for det=\r\nails, acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said the=\r\ny did not know how much electricity was actually produced Monday.=20\r\nCalpine, which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from Los=\r\n Medanos, is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn't immediat=\r\nely available for the media, spokeswoman Katherine Potter said.=20\r\n\"Even if it was two megawatts, that's two more megawatts that we didn't hav=\r\ne yesterday,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20\r\nHe said the opening was \"largely ceremonial,\" timed for the convenience of =\r\nthe governor and Calpine's top executive.=20\r\nBut consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the media event \"a deception=\r\n.\" It was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has a=\r\nttended in the past two weeks.=20\r\n\"It's the governor trying to convince people he's hard at work solving the =\r\nproblem when it's all for show,\" Rosenfield said. \"He's governing by sound =\r\nbite. He's certainly getting his money's worth from the consultants he hire=\r\nd.\"=20\r\nDavis political adviser Garry South said last week that the governor's new =\r\nradio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in Calif=\r\nornia.=20\r\n\"Generation comes up in our polls as being the No. 1 thing people want us t=\r\no do -- build more power plants,\" South said then. \"People want the sense t=\r\nhat progress is being made -- that this is not spiraling out of control.\"=\r\n=20\r\nThe other two plants that Davis kicked off -- Sunrise in Kern County and Su=\r\ntter near Yuba City -- have since been running at maximum capacity.=20\r\nCalpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of Los Medanos withi=\r\nn a week to 10 days, company officials said.=20\r\n\"In the first month of these new plants, there are always stops and starts,=\r\n\" said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander. \"Sometimes we shut down altogethe=\r\nr.\"=20\r\nIncluding the three just-opened facilities, new or expanded power plants ar=\r\ne expected to add 1,500 megawatts to the state's struggling electric grid b=\r\ny the end of July, and 870 megawatts of that is already in place, according=\r\n to the state Independent System Operator.=20\r\nAnother 1,000 megawatts is anticipated for the end of August and 1,100 more=\r\n for the end of September, under a rough timetable that is likely to see so=\r\nme plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind.=20\r\n\r\nThe Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.=\r\ncom .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState reveals high-priced power deals=20\r\nBy Dale Kasler and Chris Bowman\r\nBee Staff Writers\r\n(Published July 10, 2001)=20\r\nThe state Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity o=\r\nn the spot market, revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wild=\r\nly within minutes.=20\r\nThe Department of Water Resources, which has been criticized for keeping it=\r\ns power-purchasing practices a secret, released 1,770 pages of invoices and=\r\n trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purcha=\r\nses since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan. 17. The informatio=\r\nn was released a week after state Controller Kathleen Connell put out detai=\r\nls of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gra=\r\ny Davis, her political nemesis.=20\r\nThe state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of Cal=\r\nifornia's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising ques=\r\ntions from lawmakers and others about Davis' policies for resolving the sta=\r\nte's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of=\r\n gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.=20\r\nWhen it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a=\r\n business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days =\r\nin January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot=\r\n cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largel=\r\ny because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their depe=\r\nndence on spot sales.=20\r\n\"Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum,\" sai=\r\nd Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.=20\r\nThe information released Monday covered the first three months of the year =\r\nand didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for elec=\r\ntricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas gene=\r\nrator that owns several plants in the state. Duke Energy Corp. of North Car=\r\nolina charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but t=\r\nhat sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state'=\r\ns transmission grid.=20\r\nThe documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy =\r\npower for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.=20\r\nThrough May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent o=\r\nf San Diego Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energ=\r\ny Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a=\r\nbout $23.7 million.=20\r\nAmong others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 m=\r\nillion through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; At=\r\nlanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville =\r\nPower Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility Dis=\r\ntrict $80.7 million.=20\r\nGenerally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the price=\r\ns. For instance, Oklahoma-based generator Williams Cos. commanded $565 a me=\r\ngawatt-hour March 20, when blackouts struck more than 1 million Californian=\r\ns.=20\r\nLocation also was critical. On March 8 the state paid the PG&E trading unit=\r\n $250 but only $180 to Arizona-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The differ=\r\nence was that PG&E's power was delivered to energy-starved Northern Califor=\r\nnia, while Pinnacle's was sent to Southern California where energy wasn't s=\r\no scarce.=20\r\nSplit-second timing was also crucial. At 9:09 a.m. Feb. 14, the state paid =\r\n$400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day. By 10 a.m. it was pa=\r\nying Mieco Inc., a Long Beach trading firm, $475 for the same product.=20\r\n\"That's the spot market -- it's the most volatile market in the world, and =\r\nit changes on a second-by-second basis,\" said Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Pa=\r\nlmer.=20\r\nFor all the criticism leveled at Duke, Reliant and other big corporations, =\r\ngovernment-owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high p=\r\nrices.=20\r\nBC Hydro, the electric utility owned by the Canadian province of British Co=\r\nlumbia, submitted bills for up to $1,000 a megawatt-hour. The city of Glend=\r\nale charged $375 a megawatt-hour for power in January, while SMUD charged $=\r\n309 a megawatt-hour in March. The city of Eugene, Ore., averaged $450 a meg=\r\nawatt-hour in February.=20\r\n\"We play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace,\" said BC Hydro =\r\nspokesman Wayne Cousins. \"Our traders worked very hard to find additional s=\r\nources of electricity to keep the lights on in California. Had we not come =\r\nthrough and stepped forward with these supplies, the consequences to Califo=\r\nrnia customers would have been severe.\"=20\r\nThe state also said it has spent $14.4 million on administrative costs in b=\r\nuying power.=20\r\n\r\nThe Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co=\r\nm .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment finds ways to conserve: The Santa Rita Jail goes solar as agenci=\r\nes get creative to cut costs.\r\nBy Cheryl Miller\r\nBee Correspondent\r\n(Published July 10, 2001)=20\r\nTo Matt Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa Rita =\r\nJail in Dublin aren't just energy-makers; they're money in the bank.=20\r\nWhen all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt=\r\n photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the=\r\n United States -- will cut the jail's demand on the electric grid by up to =\r\n20 percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.=20\r\nThat sun power, combined with conservation projects already completed at th=\r\ne jail, will slash about $300,000 a year from the facility's energy bill. M=\r\nuniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.=20\r\n\"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a bu=\r\nsiness decision, just investing your money,\" said Muniz. \"There's virtually=\r\n no maintenance on this equipment. It just sits on your roof and converts r=\r\night into electricity that you're using as soon as you generate it. I think=\r\n (solar) is the wave of the future, even though it's been around 30 or 40 y=\r\nears.\"=20\r\nThe Santa Rita Jail project is among the largest, and perhaps most conspicu=\r\nous, examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity us=\r\ne in response to skyrocketing power bills and Gov. Gray Davis' call for pub=\r\nlic entities to conserve.=20\r\nAmong the examples:=20\r\nSan Francisco leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar-powered=\r\n rooftop projects around the city.=20\r\nThe Tulare County town of Lindsay will open City Hall two hours earlier -- =\r\nat 6 a.m.-- and close at 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday this summer so o=\r\nffices can stay dark all day Friday and during peak-use afternoon hours.=20\r\nSacramento County has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can bet=\r\nter withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees. Workers=\r\n have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps oper=\r\nate during low demand.=20\r\n\"When you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns fr=\r\nom some citizens, that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help ou=\r\nt,\" said Jolena Voorhis, an energy analyst at the California State Associat=\r\nion of Counties. \"Certainly (counties) stepped up to the plate when they we=\r\nre asked to increase conservation efforts. They've done about as much as hu=\r\nmanly possible.\"=20\r\nKings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signe=\r\nd up for Southern California Edison's interruptible load program, which pro=\r\nmises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrica=\r\nl services in times of shortage.=20\r\nThen California's power crisis hit full-force this year. Since January, Edi=\r\nson has called on the Central Valley county to cut electricity at its Hanfo=\r\nrd government center 16 times -- for up to six hours each cycle.=20\r\nAt times that meant no lights to greet the public, no computers to process =\r\nfood stamp requests and during the Valley's foggy winter days, no heat to w=\r\narm many of the 1,200 employees.=20\r\n\"We had one week in January when we were virtually shut down,\" said Chief A=\r\ndministrative Officer Larry Spikes. \"We just decided we couldn't function t=\r\nhat way.\"=20\r\nSo Kings County supervisors bought a $550,000 diesel-powered generator to m=\r\natch those already at the jail and juvenile center. They also decided to op=\r\nen and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildin=\r\ngs can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 p.m.=20\r\nThe new hours, dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the =\r\ngenerators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business =\r\nthese days, Spikes said.=20\r\nSo far, most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without =\r\ncutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years=\r\n, Voorhis said.=20\r\nPublic agencies' power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses.=20\r\nRevenues at PowerLight, the Berkeley company that installed the Santa Rita =\r\nJail photovoltaic system, have tripled since last year.=20\r\n\"The last six months have been particularly intense,\" said Janice Lin, dire=\r\nctor of business development for PowerLight. \"In some ways the energy crisi=\r\ns in California has been a call to action.\"=20\r\nThe Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which already boasts the largest=\r\n photovoltaic program in the country, has a 2,000-customer waiting list for=\r\n solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state Capitol, said Don=\r\n Osborn, SMUD's solar program manager.=20\r\nBack in Dublin, the 3,600 inmates at the Santa Rita Jail still receive thre=\r\ne meals, air conditioning and hot showers -- powered now, in part, by the p=\r\nlentiful sun in this relatively fog-free part of the East Bay.=20\r\nThe $4 million project, financed entirely with state and utility subsidies,=\r\n should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade, Muniz =\r\nsaid.=20\r\n\"It's a good investment for the money we're putting up front,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Energy talks reach no settlement; state threatens suit        By Mark Sh=\r\nerman ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the =\r\nstate and power generators stalled, California may go to court to help win =\r\nthe $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity=\r\n.  \"I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the j=\r\nudge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less,\"=\r\n said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.  With negotiations at=\r\n an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory=\r\n Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in ref=\r\nunds.    \"The numbers were too far apart,\" said Curtis Wagner, the FERC chi=\r\nef administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing =\r\nat all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for an=\r\ny overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 millio=\r\nn and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an ov=\r\nerall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wag=\r\nner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 bill=\r\nion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may=\r\n ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges f=\r\nrom the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those all=\r\negations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner serv=\r\ned as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a se=\r\nttlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last mont=\r\nh in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over =\r\nthe breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer adv=\r\nocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue =\r\nits attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power compan=\r\nies.  \"It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give bac=\r\nk all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole,\" said =\r\nDouglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpaye=\r\nr and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased w=\r\nith Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, said=\r\n even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, \"t=\r\nhat's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks.\"  Calif=\r\nornia officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities C=\r\nommission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating sup=\r\nply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices ar=\r\ne high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power=\r\n plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power=\r\n in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year bef=\r\nore. Davis has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this =\r\nyear.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossl=\r\ny inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - Duke Energy, Dynegy, =\r\nMirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. - said in a statement that the=\r\ny have made a \"very substantial global settlement offer.\"  Reliant would ag=\r\nree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement=\r\n that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, s=\r\naid John H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, \"=\r\nReliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are jus=\r\ntified.\"              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees p=\r\nossibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert =\r\n COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between=\r\n California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collap=\r\nsed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal reg=\r\nulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 bill=\r\nion in refunds.  \"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of =\r\ndollars and maybe a billion dollars,\" Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administr=\r\native law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previ=\r\newing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who =\r\nmediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f=\r\nor electricity \"that probably are higher than any overcharges\" for which th=\r\ney may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California co=\r\nuld see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po=\r\nwer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util=\r\nities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a \"fast-track hearing=\r\n\" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising=\r\n from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai=\r\nd FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula incl=\r\nudes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for ca=\r\nlculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintai=\r\nn that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  \"I would suspect that =\r\nwould result in a number much below $8.9 billion,\" said Joe Ronan, vice pre=\r\nsident of Calpine, a San Jose-based electricity generator. \"I think (Wagner=\r\n's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened\" in the state's =\r\ndysfunctional power market.  But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator,=\r\n said Wagner \"vindicated\" California's core arguments.  \"The hundreds of pe=\r\nople who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there =\r\nshould not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected,\" said Kah=\r\nn, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power gri=\r\nd.  \"We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be =\r\nin the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, =\r\nwe will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the r=\r\nemainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its=\r\n $8.9 billion.\"  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation r=\r\nemains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their con=\r\nduct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position. =\r\n During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhe=\r\nre near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers h=\r\nad put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  \"That's a long way from=\r\n splitting the difference,\" he said. \"In 15 days, you can't work miracles.\"=\r\n  Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will betwee=\r\nn the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the pr=\r\neviously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of barga=\r\nining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  John H.=\r\n Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the=\r\n state used \"biased calculations\" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund dema=\r\nnd. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 mil=\r\nlion it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot b=\r\nack that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approach=\r\ned the state.  Figures scrutinized \"This is the first time we've heard any =\r\nof this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been c=\r\nooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading,\" Kahn said.  The stat=\r\ne's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The =\r\n$8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera=\r\ntor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when=\r\n wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli=\r\ncated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b=\r\neen if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo=\r\nr the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to =\r\ntame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner =\r\nsaid he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis fo=\r\nr calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he s=\r\naid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, an=\r\nd should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula=\r\nted.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas=\r\n heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr=\r\nices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rath=\r\ner than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Tho=\r\nse and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre=\r\nase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over=\r\ncharges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to Octobe=\r\nr would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  Brent=\r\n Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North America, =\r\nsaid, \"We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast improvement o=\r\nver FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's) model.\"  Ame=\r\nrica.  In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the=\r\n electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith.  =\r\n\"While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers=\r\n, they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 =\r\nbillion California has demonstrated it is owed,\" Davis said.  Despite the h=\r\narsh rhetoric, both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reac=\r\nh one-on-one settlements.  Ronan of Calpine said the generator was close to=\r\n making a deal with the state. Bailey said that while Duke would continue t=\r\no push for a \"global settlement\" between all the parties, \"We've had seriou=\r\ns settlement talks with the state over the last few days and hope to contin=\r\nue.\"               State's massive outlays detailed        Energy bill exce=\r\neded $100 million on 3 days By Jennifer Coleman  ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10,=\r\n 2001  SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spendin=\r\ng topped $100 million, according to a report released yesterday by state po=\r\nwer traders.  The California Department of Water Resources report, which ad=\r\ndressed spot market electricity purchases since January, was released along=\r\n with 1,770 pages of documents that specifically detailed the first three m=\r\nonths of last-minute power purchases.  Such power buys on the spot market t=\r\nypically get the most expensive electricity available.  The report details =\r\nthe department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov=\r\ner electricity purchases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., San Diego Gas & =\r\nElectric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bi=\r\nllions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. S=\r\nince then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  Th=\r\ne state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highes=\r\nt daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million. The day befo=\r\nre, the state spent $100 million.  But since May, spot market prices have d=\r\nropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, increase=\r\nd conservation which lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by la=\r\nwmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis=\r\n has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  \"It does look lik=\r\ne some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it looks like it's pri=\r\nmarily due to natural gas prices,\" said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for Assembl=\r\ny Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot market prices \"underscores que=\r\nstions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natura=\r\nl gas prices continue to drop,\" Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term contrac=\r\nts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  \"It's unfortunate that=\r\n it looks like we'll never get out from under these contracts,\" Fisfis said=\r\n.  Davis has already released details of the state's long-term power contra=\r\ncts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several new=\r\ns organizations, including The Associated Press and The Copley Press, which=\r\n publishes The San Diego Union-Tribune.  Davis released copies of those con=\r\ntracts, but wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short-t=\r\nerm contracts. Releasing those details too soon after the purchases would r=\r\neveal the state's buying strategy and could cause generators to raise their=\r\n already sky-high prices, Davis said.  The number of spot market buys will =\r\nlessen, the Davis administration says, as more long-term contracts are sign=\r\ned, reducing the state's exposure to the high-priced purchases.  The govern=\r\nor's office will release future short-term contracts and spot market buys w=\r\nill be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag time. Second quarte=\r\nr information will be released in October and third quarter documents will =\r\nbe available in January.  Davis maintains the delay is needed to protect it=\r\ns ability to negotiate further spot-market power buys.  According to the wa=\r\nter department, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has been p=\r\naid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.  But Atlanta-base=\r\nd Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as of the end of May=\r\n.  The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state had to =\r\npay when it needed power the most.  On March 19 and 20, when rolling blacko=\r\nuts hit California again, the state was forced into paying above-average pr=\r\nices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold the sta=\r\nte 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345 a meg=\r\nawatt hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96.  The day befo=\r\nre, Mirant charged $343 a megawatt hour at off-peak in northern California =\r\nwhen the average cost was $254.52.  Also on March 19, Mirant charged the st=\r\nate about $96 above the average price for power in Northern California on a=\r\n sale of 6,400 megawatt hours during off-peak times.

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1=\r\n Billion From Associated Press  July 9 2001  WASHINGTON -- California is ow=\r\ned no more than \"a billion dollars\" from power wholesalers, a federal regul=\r\natory judge said today at the end of 15 days of settlement talks in the sta=\r\nte's electricity crisis.  Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=\r\nission's chief administrative law judge, said that at the same time the pow=\r\ner suppliers probably are owed more than that.  The net effect of his preli=\r\nminary recommendation is that California probably will receive no refunds f=\r\nrom wholesalers.  Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in =\r\nrefunds. The state has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said h=\r\ne will not recommend refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.  =\r\nIt was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary recommenda=\r\ntion would have on efforts to settle the dispute.  Both sides said before t=\r\nhe judge's announcement that they expected a protracted legal battle in the=\r\n event the talks did not produce a settlement.  Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Dav=\r\nis's representative in the talks, has said the state would seek more than t=\r\nwice the claimed overcharges if the dispute moved from mediated talks to a =\r\ncourtroom.  The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are gr=\r\nossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dyne=\r\ngy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that=\r\n they have made a \"very substantial global settlement offer.\"  John H. Stou=\r\nt, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company would agree=\r\n to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall settlement t=\r\nhat also would have to include protection from additional legal claims.  Bu=\r\nt Stout also said, \"Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains tha=\r\nt no refunds are justified.\"  FERC ordered the talks last month in an effor=\r\nt to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown=\r\n of California's deregulated electricity market.  The state has accused the=\r\n producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices. The producer=\r\ns have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of n=\r\natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free mar=\r\nket.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last=\r\n year from $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state c=\r\nould spend as much as $50 billion this year.  ----  On the Net:  Federal En=\r\nergy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/   Copyright 2001, Los A=\r\nngeles Times       Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppl=\r\niers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show. RI=\r\nCH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 =\r\n2001  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more divers=\r\ne group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davi=\r\ns, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records =\r\nshow.  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretch=\r\nes of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and privat=\r\ne entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid=\r\n to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by =\r\nthe Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.  Am=\r\nong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per meg=\r\nawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & =\r\nElectric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=\r\nr, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour =\r\ncharged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292=\r\n an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies s=\r\ningled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., D=\r\nuke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid =\r\nfor the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=\r\nr megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.  The figures co=\r\nver the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state =\r\nduring three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month o=\r\nf razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies.  Davis spok=\r\nesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at p=\r\nrivate out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the hi=\r\nghest profits over the longest period.  \"You have to look at the whole pict=\r\nure,\" Maviglio said.  \"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the=\r\n arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,\" he said. \"Their profits=\r\n were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other enti=\r\nties who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact t=\r\nhat we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or =\r\nCharlotte.\"  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided t=\r\no The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on =\r\nCalifornia's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year=\r\n's first quarter.  The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion=\r\n buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the comp=\r\nlexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high =\r\nprices are not limited to a few generators.  Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for=\r\n the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that price=\r\ns were extremely volatile early in the year. \"All the prices were high,\" he=\r\n said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying pow=\r\ner in mid-January.  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purch=\r\nases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an ave=\r\nrage of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of t=\r\nhe year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest pri=\r\nvate companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's bigge=\r\nst power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta=\r\n-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, c=\r\nharged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.  By contrast, a Calgary, Canad=\r\na, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacrament=\r\no Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.=\r\n  A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the \"vilification =\r\nof Enron was based on politics, not facts.\" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could no=\r\nt be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the =\r\npast, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=\r\n last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.  =\r\nA spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, s=\r\naid late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see=\r\n the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reac=\r\nhed Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of produc=\r\ning the power needed by the state were extremely high.  More Power Bought T=\r\nhan Projected  Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agen=\r\ncy's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falli=\r\nng natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market.  Still, the s=\r\ntate had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more=\r\n than Davis' analysts had projected.  Hidlago said that was because of hot =\r\nweather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will sho=\r\nw that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early Ju=\r\nly.  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in =\r\nJune and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to wel=\r\nl under $100 a megawatt-hour.  A summary Department of Water Resources repo=\r\nrt released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generatio=\r\nn and establishing long-term power contracts with with \"moving the Californ=\r\nia electric energy industry closer to normalcy.\"  Copyright 2001, Los Angel=\r\nes Times       Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator sa=\r\nys the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the=\r\n price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRI=\r\nTER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing=\r\n suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday=\r\n that Duke Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key t=\r\no his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the pr=\r\nice bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee m=\r\nembers and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data can=\r\nnot be made public without Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula=\r\n Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to=\r\n drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records=\r\n show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyratio=\r\nns to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal=\r\n thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedi=\r\nal legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with o=\r\nthers in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the=\r\n Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority =\r\nto decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  \"The only o=\r\nne who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what is provi=\r\nded in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less,\" he said.  Former Employees T=\r\nell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to ob=\r\ntain the information elsewhere and \"release it over Duke's objections.\"  Th=\r\nree former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month =\r\nunder oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=\r\nat seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergen=\r\ncy.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=\r\n California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricit=\r\ny grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its exp=\r\nlanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to pro=\r\nvide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Du=\r\nnn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said =\r\nMonday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, Du=\r\nke was guilty of the same tactics.  \"Duke is trying to draw the impression =\r\nthat it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we c=\r\nannot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. Tha=\r\nt hasn't occurred,\" Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula V=\r\nista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must p=\r\nublicly examine \"the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders t=\r\no the plant.\" They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, =\r\nhe said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several pla=\r\nnts in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and =\r\noff-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom William=\r\ns insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's =\r\ndemands. But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidd=\r\ning documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn o=\r\nver.  \"We are complying now,\" Williams said. \"There is some suggestion that=\r\n we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I=\r\n don't know what we are ultimately going to do.\"  The committee had threate=\r\nned to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidd=\r\ning documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have said they would compl=\r\ny to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn sa=\r\nid the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to=\r\n comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charge=\r\nd with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the fina=\r\nl arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying pe=\r\nnalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing seve=\r\nre fines.

Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        NEWS ANALYSIS Concern =\r\nOver Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows Embedded costs may yield more rat=\r\ne hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion total could complicate plans to r=\r\nescue Edison. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve=\r\nn as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray Davis prepares =\r\nfor yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power=\r\n plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting =\r\ntask of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-la=\r\nsting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for =\r\nconsumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by =\r\nthe governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-=\r\ncontrol electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A gr=\r\nowing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat=\r\ning one of Davis' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial r=\r\nescue of Southern California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate =\r\nin the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readie=\r\ns a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund f=\r\nor other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac=\r\nts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead =\r\nto additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer=\r\n advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact=\r\ns be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these=\r\n critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts=\r\n and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the d=\r\neals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the st=\r\nate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f=\r\nor more than 25 million residents.  \"They are vulnerable,\" Senate Energy Co=\r\nmmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state s=\r\ntruck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  B=\r\nowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing \"the best deals the=\r\ny could.\" But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati=\r\nons took place, \"the state had two cards and the generators had 50.\"  Contr=\r\nacts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, mor=\r\ne immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto=\r\nn. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework=\r\ned as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar=\r\nged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  \"We ought not to say, 'Fine=\r\n, the contracts were the best we could do,' \" Bowen said.  For his part, Da=\r\nvis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the=\r\n form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes th=\r\ne recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the ad=\r\nministration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon=\r\ng-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily,=\r\n or spot, market.  \"You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . =\r\n. dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Califo=\r\nrnians,\" Davis said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30=\r\n% from May to June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped nego=\r\ntiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, gi=\r\nven the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for Califor=\r\nnia's electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to some=\r\none who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. \"After the fire is out,=\r\n\" he said, \"you complain about the water damage.\"  The contracts have other=\r\n defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, =\r\nwho says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene=\r\nrators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure t=\r\no wild swings in price.  \"The point of signing long-term contracts is not t=\r\no get a great price; it's to reduce risk,\" Borenstein said.  Still, experts=\r\n have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S=\r\nan Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz=\r\nations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Davis unseal the c=\r\nontracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep=\r\nresenting Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consume=\r\nr group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-bill=\r\nion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c=\r\nosts. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip=\r\nment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an =\r\nadditional 10% to 20%.  \"Once the contracts were made public,\" Senate Repub=\r\nlican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, \"just about anyone who ca=\r\nn read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated.\"  As buyers' r=\r\nemorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as =\r\na hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa=\r\nching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing =\r\ninto a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc=\r\ny for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b=\r\ny Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is schedu=\r\nled to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along wi=\r\nth legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which=\r\n has little apparent support, would require the state to buy Edison's syste=\r\nm of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge =\r\nratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists a=\r\nnd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th=\r\ne California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la=\r\nrgest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the =\r\nnew rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an=\r\nd repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest muni=\r\ncipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t=\r\nhe Edison rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may n=\r\need to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contr=\r\nacts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he=\r\n concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses =\r\npolitical lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers =\r\nUnion, and Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Tech=\r\nnology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in s=\r\neparate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  \"If there is a way to buy=\r\n our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be be=\r\ntter off in the long run,\" Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leade=\r\nrs, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with=\r\n the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  \"They are proble=\r\nmatic,\" he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit=\r\ny prices for the next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t=\r\no agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by=\r\n the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State=\r\n Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.=\r\n4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i=\r\nnvestors can be assured that they will be repaid.  \"The state will be out o=\r\nf cash by the end of the year without the bond sale,\" he said. \"We will mov=\r\ne toward fiscal insolvency.\"  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of whic=\r\nh was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulate=\r\nd utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 b=\r\nillion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to p=\r\nay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t=\r\nhe Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated=\r\n to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm=\r\nall customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not appr=\r\noved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department=\r\n of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this=\r\n year and next.  \"It is loaded up,\" Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D=\r\n-San Francisco) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would requir=\r\ne the commission to \"raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water =\r\nResources decides to do.\"  \"That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat=\r\nic office,\" he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  Stewart of the manufactu=\r\nrers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water a=\r\ngency with \"dictatorial power.\"  \"As skeptical as we are of the PUC process=\r\n, at least there is a process,\" Stewart said, referring to the commission's=\r\n procedures to set electricity rates. \"There is no process for DWR. DWR jus=\r\nt tells the PUC, 'This is what we need,' and the PUC must approve it.\"  Oth=\r\ners say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordi=\r\nnary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department=\r\n of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in=\r\nto debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers. =\r\n In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January create=\r\nd \"the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency\" beyond the jurisdict=\r\nion of the PUC.  \"There is no public power agency in California that is rev=\r\niewed by the PUC,\" said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department =\r\nof Water and Power.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angel=\r\nes contributed to this story.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        Sta=\r\nte's refund demand rejected  Judge ends rebate talks, rebukes $9 billion cl=\r\naim  Zachary Coile, Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writers  Tuesday,=\r\n July 10, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/=\r\ncgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/07/10/MN117914.DTL   Washington -- An adm=\r\ninistrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to Gov. Gray Davis and=\r\n California energy officials, cast aside the state's claim that it is owed =\r\n$8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for furthe=\r\nr hearings to determine \"hard numbers.\"  The judge, ending talks designed t=\r\no settle the dispute between California and power sellers, said the state a=\r\nnd its cash-strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills tha=\r\nn they are owed for overcharges by the generators.  The comments by Federal=\r\n Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis L. Wagn=\r\ner, although a strong endorsement of the generators' position, seemed to in=\r\ndicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the f=\r\nive-member regulatory commission.  \"There are refunds due (to California) t=\r\nhat total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars,\" Wag=\r\nner said yesterday.  \"At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from =\r\nthe California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities=\r\n in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t=\r\nhat (the state) may come up with.\"  Now, it will be up to the federal regul=\r\nators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated t=\r\nhe talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th=\r\ne state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=\r\n  The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t=\r\no calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearing=\r\ns would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 =\r\ndays, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing=\r\n session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulato=\r\nry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca=\r\nlifornia officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a=\r\n sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D=\r\navis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for=\r\n California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the=\r\n close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s=\r\ntate is owed refunds.  \"I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo=\r\nlogy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no =\r\nrefunds are due,\" Davis said.  The governor's chief representative at the t=\r\nalks, Michael Kahn, called the judge's statement a \"ringing endorsement\" of=\r\n the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve th=\r\ne state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATOR=\r\nS FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  Fo=\r\nr example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9=\r\n billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t=\r\nhe regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 200=\r\n0 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t=\r\nhe October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at =\r\nleast $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  Brent Bailey,=\r\n vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America, said that=\r\n under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.=\r\n5 billion.  \"Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California =\r\nhas been saying, it's a victory,\" Bailey said of the judge's statement.  Bu=\r\nt Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a =\r\nserious offer.  \"Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer=\r\ns out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f=\r\naith,\" Davis said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the=\r\n generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The =\r\njudge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Fi=\r\nve generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 milli=\r\non by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California =\r\nmunicipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel=\r\nlers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in=\r\ncluded no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of=\r\n the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complain=\r\ned that the California team was trying to shield some California companies =\r\nand government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying t=\r\no disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVOR=\r\nITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to=\r\n remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego=\r\n Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g=\r\novernment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun=\r\nds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el=\r\nse.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad=\r\ne a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom=\r\nise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputa=\r\ntion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.  \"The Califo=\r\nrnia delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compr=\r\nomise,\" said Mark Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supply Assoc=\r\niation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. \"They went in with a dollar figure=\r\n and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement, you h=\r\nave to be willing to compromise.\"  Up next 1. The Federal Energy Regulatory=\r\n Commission will consider, probably on July 25,  new hearings on how much, =\r\nif anything, California was overcharged. 2. If ordered by the commission, a=\r\nn administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says i=\r\nt was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed. 3. Regulators =\r\nwill rule based on the judge's recommendation. If the parties disagree, the=\r\ny can go to court.

Gray Davi=\r\ns celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the=\r\n latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help California \"build its=\r\n way\" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to throw as many megawatts=\r\n on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular b=\r\nlackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was paying off.  \"This is the =\r\nthird plant I've helped open in the last 13 days,\" Davis said, pumping his =\r\nfist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of steam. \"In t=\r\nhe past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than California did throu=\r\nghout the 1990s.\"  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutte=\r\nr Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of=\r\n 1,115 megawatts online. Last month, Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfiel=\r\nd plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule.  Davis used yester=\r\nday's event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged =\r\nthe state for electricity. Yet he lauded San Jose-based Calpine as a sort o=\r\nf energy favorite son.  \"They were the first to enter long-term contracts w=\r\nith us,\" the governor said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pre=\r\nssed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overc=\r\nharges, but unlike the others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in nego=\r\ntiations.  \"They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us=\r\n,\" he said.  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of effic=\r\nient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to ru=\r\nn than their forebears, the state will be paying well above current market =\r\nrates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine.  Calpine Pre=\r\nsident Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is not making e=\r\nxcess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide the electr=\r\nicity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July target dat=\r\ne, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232 a =\r\nmegawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.  In addition to the 3=\r\n00 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will supply electricity t=\r\no the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies.  In t=\r\nhe long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a megawatt=\r\n hour, Cartwright said.  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Reso=\r\nurces, which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled =\r\nunder high prices, said Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hou=\r\nr the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts. =\r\n Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875- m=\r\negawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is doi=\r\nng its share to ease the state's supply crunch.  \"Ours are the lowest contr=\r\nacts in the state,\" he said. \"If these plants weren't online, we'd be havin=\r\ng blackouts.\"  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power g=\r\nrid said California is skating so close to blackouts that \"every megawatt c=\r\nounts.\"  \"It's definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so=\r\n over the summer,\" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the Independent S=\r\nystem Operator.

Hydro's power trading sub=\r\nsidiary to refund $125 million to settle the state's allegations that it wa=\r\ns overcharged by the Canadian power company.  The dispute will now be resol=\r\nved by U.S. judicial and regulatory authorities.  The offer from Hydro's Po=\r\nwerex subsidiary came during 15 days of settlement talks between power gene=\r\nrators and distributors, California and other western states.  The talks, i=\r\nnitiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates cross=\r\n-border power sales in the United States, concluded Monday evening without =\r\nresolution.  Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Odowichuk said that under the offer, =\r\nthe Crown corporation would have been subtracted $125 million from the $290=\r\n million California still owes British Columbia for power sales.  The $125 =\r\nmillion was Powerex's first offer and it did not change through the negotia=\r\ntions, she said. The company put conditions on that refund figure, but Odow=\r\nichuk would not say what those conditions were.  California has charged tha=\r\nt Powerex gouged it by more than $430 million. Odowichuk said Hydro had to =\r\njoin the settlement talks to preserve its otherwise lucrative power trading=\r\n relationship with California.  Electricity imports and exports statistics =\r\ncompiled by Canada's National Energy Board show Powerex exported more than =\r\n$900 million worth of energy from January to April.  The average cost of th=\r\nat power was $661.56 a megawatt hour.

Gray Davis for gouging California during the power cris=\r\nis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of =\r\nthe money went elsewhere.  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered le=\r\nss than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, wh=\r\nile public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to Californi=\r\na got the rest.  The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be=\r\n more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials=\r\n are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of=\r\n Texas.  Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not=\r\n acting against power firms in his home state. \"What's going on here, pure =\r\nand simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- =\r\nmost of them, incidentally, located in Texas,\" he said in May.  Yesterday, =\r\na spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas=\r\n firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who hav=\r\ne also gouged California.  \"Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably h=\r\nave handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind,\" sai=\r\nd Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.  The latest financial information is co=\r\nntained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7=\r\n.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.  About $=\r\n5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made =\r\na day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. =\r\n Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most =\r\nexpensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and =\r\nbuy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropp=\r\ned as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of even=\r\nts that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could re=\r\ncover from customers.  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas compa=\r\nnies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2=\r\n billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to tu=\r\nrn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its invest=\r\nigation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt procee=\r\ndings.  Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis.=\r\n Powerex,  a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC =\r\nHydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.  The=\r\n Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher=\r\n average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.

THE PROBLEM: High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmis=\r\nsion glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in =\r\nthe Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all fact=\r\nors in California's electricity crisis.  Southern California Edison and Pac=\r\nific Gas and Electric say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June 2000 t=\r\no high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them =\r\nfrom passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it n=\r\needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy prote=\r\nction April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the com=\r\npanies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the stat=\r\ne in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million resi=\r\ndential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third =\r\ninvestor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financ=\r\nial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but is also struggling with high=\r\n wholesale power costs.  The Public Utilities Commission has approved avera=\r\nge rate increases of 37 percent for the heaviest residential customers and =\r\n38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for indu=\r\nstrial customers and 15 percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to=\r\n help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

Gray=\r\n Davis.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for =\r\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed n=\r\no more than $1 billion in refunds.  \"The numbers were too far apart,\" said =\r\nCurtis Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner=\r\n said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than=\r\n they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the s=\r\ntate at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $7=\r\n16 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officia=\r\nls sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not =\r\nmade the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the stat=\r\ne would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split =\r\noff claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had=\r\n time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FE=\r\nRC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiati=\r\nons and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission =\r\nordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between pr=\r\noducers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electr=\r\nicity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and u=\r\nrged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say ar=\r\ne profiteering power companies.  \"It's like catching a bank robber, but ins=\r\ntead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 perce=\r\nnt of what he stole,\" said Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-b=\r\nased Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, howeve=\r\nr, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general co=\r\nunsel for Duke Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces =\r\n$1.5 billion in refunds, \"that's a reasonable amount in the context of thes=\r\ne settlement talks.\"  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilit=\r\nies, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the pr=\r\noducers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers =\r\nhave acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural =\r\ngas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  T=\r\nhe bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year f=\r\nrom $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated the state could spend a=\r\ns much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that Cali=\r\nfornia's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generat=\r\nors -- Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. --=\r\n said in a statement that they have made a \"very substantial global settlem=\r\nent offer.\"  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as =\r\npart of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection fr=\r\nom additional legal claims, said John H. Stout, a company senior vice presi=\r\ndent.  But Stout also said, \"Reliant's fundamental position has been and re=\r\nmains that no refunds are justified.\"       Toxic fumes not linked to black=\r\nouts  Backup power OK in facilities, report says  Jason B. Johnson, Chronic=\r\nle Staff Writer  Tuesday, July 10, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   UR=\r\nL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001=\r\n/07/10/MNC115768.DTL   Despite a power-related mishap that released toxic f=\r\numes from an industrial plant in May, rolling blackouts are not expected to=\r\n cause dangerous releases in Contra Costa, a county study concludes.  The c=\r\nounty Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities have ade=\r\nquate backup power plans.  The report to be presented to the Board of Super=\r\nvisors today was prompted by a freak traffic accident that knocked out powe=\r\nr at Richmond's General Chemical Corp. plant. When the plant powered back u=\r\np, a cloud of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released.  Contra Cost=\r\na hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a pos=\r\nsibility that a plant's hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that=\r\n those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming o=\r\nnline and the state's successful conservation effort.  He also said industr=\r\ny has done a good job preparing for outages.  \"The industry is doing a good=\r\n-faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens=\r\n,\" Pascalli said.  County officials relied on industry records in determini=\r\nng the adequacy of the different plans, such as having multiple electrical =\r\nleads feeding a source regulating hazardous materials.  Denny Larson, spoke=\r\nsman for the group Communities for a Better Environment, said the report re=\r\nlied too heavily on industry self-reporting.  \"Unfortunately, the conclusio=\r\nns of the report can't be backed up by the facts,\" Larson said. \"Oil and ch=\r\nemical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to pow=\r\ner failures over the years.\"  The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oi=\r\nl refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous mate=\r\nrials.  For many of these businesses, the loss of power would shut down the=\r\nir operations and make it impossible for substances to be released.  Larger=\r\n facilities, like oil refineries, have either their own backup generators o=\r\nr contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply all or most of their=\r\n power independent of the electricity power grid, according to the report. =\r\n Plans are also in place to conduct partial shutdowns at plants running on =\r\nreserve power during a blackout.  General Chemical said all electrical feed=\r\ns to the chamber processing chemicals are automatically pulled in the event=\r\n of loss of power. A backup generator will automatically come online to kee=\r\np operations stable.  Dow Chemical has a contract with a Calpine power plan=\r\nt to supply it with electricity. Battery backup and diesel emergency engine=\r\ns are also at the site to ensure enough power to run lights, alarms, contro=\r\nls and emergency shutdown equipment.  e-mail Jason B.

The judge o=\r\nverseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re=\r\nfunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His=\r\n estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers dur=\r\ning negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it w=\r\nas unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and=\r\n California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At=\r\n stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have t=\r\no pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collap=\r\nsed.  Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will =\r\nrecommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating =\r\nback to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=\r\ns such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e=\r\nnergy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  Michael Kahn, who headed t=\r\nhe California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects o=\r\nf the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the for=\r\nmula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the num=\r\nbers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billion=\r\ns,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which ru=\r\nns the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If=\r\n we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remai=\r\nnder of the money'' through the courts.  Amount in dispute  Power industry =\r\nrepresentatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.  ``We haven't gone =\r\nand run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere near the $8.9 billion=\r\n,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy =\r\nNorth America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky number that nob=\r\nody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number.''  Wagne=\r\nr acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying =\r\nhe arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers=\r\n.  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon=\r\nth when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=\r\n prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that und=\r\ner pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the =\r\npower suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat=\r\nion.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, par=\r\nticipants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on =\r\none end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to=\r\n splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties ge=\r\nnuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to =\r\nmake his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the =\r\nfinal ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million i=\r\nn refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will a=\r\nsk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed=\r\n information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun=\r\nd total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any =\r\nrefund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and=\r\n its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone =\r\nof the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp=\r\nliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve=\r\n the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepay=\r\ners out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good=\r\n faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past=\r\n the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have th=\r\ne opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California=\r\n has demonstrated it is owed.''  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a=\r\n new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis told reporters tha=\r\nt he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order=\r\n the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn'=\r\nt represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as =\r\nhigh as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures =\r\nwere calculated.  John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy W=\r\nholesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.=\r\n9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they wou=\r\nld continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Ca=\r\nlpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power supp=\r\nliers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi=\r\nons' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he w=\r\nill do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. W=\r\nagner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s=\r\nuppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officia=\r\nls wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $=\r\n8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds =\r\nbeginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the=\r\n state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commi=\r\nssion's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect=\r\nricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined f=\r\nor each hour of each day. The commission's formula sets a price limit durin=\r\ng Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen=\r\ncy.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University ec=\r\nonomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w=\r\nill produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.  ``That's the methodology=\r\n the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market iss=\r\nues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour, you'll get refund numbers =\r\non the order of what the state estimated.''

The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts a=\r\nnd other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy mar=\r\nkets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week ami=\r\nd a legal dispute over public access to the data.  In roughly the first fiv=\r\ne months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 billion to Atlanta-based M=\r\nirant, the most any company was paid for electricity, followed by $1 billio=\r\nn to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia. It also pa=\r\nid $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The docu=\r\nments raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen=\r\n around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the stat=\r\ne's purchases have come from government-run power generators in California =\r\nand elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are from the No=\r\nrthwest.  Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, ha=\r\ns put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies =\r\nbased in President Bush's home state.  The figures are tucked inside 1,770 =\r\nof pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging, saying disclosure w=\r\nould encourage suppliers to charge more. The state, which last month releas=\r\ned information on its long-term electricity contracts worth $43 billion, ag=\r\nreed Thursday to release the first quarter details.  Short on explanation  =\r\nThe figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=\r\nr Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major ut=\r\nilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the pric=\r\ne of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for wha=\r\nt prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for p=\r\nower on the spot market was $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $33=\r\n2 and dropped to $271 in May.  One megawatt powers about 750 homes.  Davis =\r\nspokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assert=\r\nions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the out-of=\r\n-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant shift of=\r\n money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on w=\r\nhether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term=\r\n power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend=\r\n that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t=\r\nhe state to pay high prices for many years.  Used for support  Republican o=\r\nfficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis,=\r\n a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as =\r\nthe price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of th=\r\ne declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants.  ``It's more cle=\r\nar than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyma=\r\nn Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers=\r\n for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the v=\r\nolatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour =\r\nranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices f=\r\nrom seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being c=\r\nharged by public utilities and companies outside Texas.  On one day in Febr=\r\nuary, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per mega=\r\nwatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly $500 and=\r\n Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging up to $575.  The state=\r\n's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including =\r\nthe spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-=\r\nJanuary on behalf of the state's major utilities, which were unable to borr=\r\now money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity.  San J=\r\nose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants around =\r\nCalifornia including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth of b=\r\nusiness with the state in the first five months of the year, according to t=\r\nhe figures.  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas &=\r\n Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financia=\r\nlly. PG&E later went into bankruptcy.  On Monday, state lawmakers took anot=\r\nher shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing E=\r\ndison.  While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison =\r\nwill not win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have creat=\r\ned several working groups to come up with alternatives.  Compromise plan  O=\r\nn Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest compro=\r\nmise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses=\r\n from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the E=\r\ndison bailout.  The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, o=\r\nwed about $1 billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive=\r\n about $300 million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 =\r\nbillion -- about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay o=\r\nff the remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for =\r\npower.  In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy =\r\npower on the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign ch=\r\neap energy deals.  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday a=\r\nfternoon, but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receiv=\r\ne in the Legislature.

July 10, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Registe=\r\nr  WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California i=\r\ns owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the=\r\n $8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.  And even at that, said Judge Cu=\r\nrtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power =\r\nbills that in the end California might not see one red cent.  Wagner announ=\r\nced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after tw=\r\no weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to California's e=\r\nlectricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now in the commissione=\r\nrs' hands.  Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 mill=\r\nion in refunds, an offer the state rejected. \"I don't think it's 8.9 (billi=\r\non dollars),\" he said afterwards, \"because I haven't been shown that it was=\r\n.\"  For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds=\r\n is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased pow=\r\ner. And the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of wardi=\r\nng off future rate increases.  \"California will get its $8.9 billion,\" insi=\r\nsted Michael Kahn, head of the state's delegation and the California Indepe=\r\nndent System Operator. Kahn brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory =\r\nin the judge's assertion that the state is owed some refunds, a concept the=\r\n generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now, he said.  Since the t=\r\nalks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week Duke Energ=\r\ny offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed their refun=\r\nd offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the company wer=\r\ne dropped.  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that =\r\nCalifornia is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price goug=\r\ning by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks=\r\n began.  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the=\r\n FERC. If unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for ye=\r\nars.  \"You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink,\" Wagner sai=\r\nd during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommen=\r\ndation. He has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points du=\r\nring the often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators=\r\n and tried to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unpreceden=\r\nted Sunday session.  \"The numbers were too far apart,\" Wagner said.  While =\r\nKahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's commen=\r\nts, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them \"barely better than a =\r\njab in the eye with a sharp stick.\" Burton agreed with Kahn that the state =\r\nhas to do all it can to get more than that.  And Davis backed up his team. =\r\n \"Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there we=\r\nre overcharges made because the market was broken,\" Davis said. \"Remarkably=\r\n, the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibi=\r\nlity to the people of California and own up to their profiteering.\"  Power =\r\ngenerators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John Stout,=\r\n vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's \"fundamental position=\r\n has been and remains that no refunds are justified.\"  Brent Bailey, genera=\r\nl counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's recommendation, \"a fair one.\"=\r\n  Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=\r\n energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=\r\n themselves from the state's refund request.  \"I don't believe there really=\r\n exists a true justification for that number,\" said Assemblyman John Campbe=\r\nll, R-Irvine. \"I've never considered that anything more than a wild number =\r\nto throw out there.\"  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of =\r\novercharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu=\r\nte the complex pricing structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the ma=\r\njority of the generators' methods.  To start with, the state is asking for =\r\n$8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be=\r\ntween May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at. FERC issued tw=\r\no refund orders in March, finding that power companies had $124 million in =\r\novercharges during power alerts. But the state is challenging that finding,=\r\n saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times. And the state is=\r\n also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000.  =\r\nHow energy panel affects California  Six months ago, few people had heard o=\r\nf FERC. Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged wi=\r\nth making sure that the nation's power markets are running smoothly and tha=\r\nt wholesale prices are \"just and reasonable,\" rolls off the tongue.  The fi=\r\nve commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home =\r\nstate's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that co=\r\nncluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's ele=\r\nctricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term pow=\r\ner contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months. FER=\r\nC's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.  WHAT WAS A=\r\nT STAKE?  For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amo=\r\nunt power companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's findi=\r\nng? There should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.  For the generators:=\r\n More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills. W=\r\nagner's finding? Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe C=\r\nalifornia. He did not specify by how much.  For California consumers: A sta=\r\nble electricity market. Until the refund issue is settled and power prices =\r\nare stabilized long term, what the future holds for rate increase remains u=\r\nncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement. Consumers still in limbo.  HOW D=\r\nID WE GET HERE?  In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The =\r\nstate began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the =\r\nutilities were running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the el=\r\nectricity they sold. Rolling blackouts began.  Starting in January, the sta=\r\nte began buying the power, replacing the near-bankrupt utilities. Politicia=\r\nns from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rate=\r\ns. More than $27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year, c=\r\nompared with $7 billion the year before. The price tag could reach $50 bill=\r\nion this year.  On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps expert=\r\ns say could moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but =\r\nthe caps have caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some =\r\npower off the market.  WHAT'S NEXT?  The FERC commissioners will receive Wa=\r\ngner's report within a week. In it, he will suggest they hold a fast-track =\r\nformal hearing that would last no more than 60 days.  If they agree, after =\r\nthat hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California mark=\r\net issues.  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagr=\r\nee, they can contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could=\r\n last many years.                State reveals details of power purchases  =\r\nReport shows last-minute energy buys in first three months of 2001.  July 1=\r\n0, 2001  By JENNIFER COLEMAN The Associated Press  SACRAMENTO On three days=\r\n in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according =\r\nto a report released by state power traders.  The California Department of =\r\nWater Resources released the report Monday, along with 1,770 pages of docum=\r\nents that also detailed the last- minute power purchases the state made on =\r\nthe spot market in the first three months of the year.  The report details =\r\nthe department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov=\r\ner electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Diego Gas & El=\r\nectric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bill=\r\nions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Sin=\r\nce then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The =\r\nstate's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest =\r\ndaily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.  But since May=\r\n, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower n=\r\natural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered demand and because o=\r\nf increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price man=\r\nipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts also drove the pric=\r\ne down.  \"It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, =\r\nbut it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices,\" said Jamie Fis=\r\nfis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot-mark=\r\net prices \"underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long=\r\n-term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop,\" Fisfis said.  Mos=\r\nt of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 year=\r\ns.  Davis already has released details of the state's long-term power contr=\r\nacts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several ne=\r\nws organizations.  But Davis wanted to delay the release of the spot-market=\r\n buys and short-term contracts until now to keep the state's buying strateg=\r\ny secret.According to the state, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. got $1.24 billi=\r\non as of May 31 for spot-market purchases.  Canadian Powerex, the marketing=\r\n arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion.  The newly released short-te=\r\nrm contracts also show that on March 19-20, when the state had rolling blac=\r\nkouts, the state paid above-average prices in its largest short-term contra=\r\ncts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usa=\r\nge times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt-hour, more than $70 above the aver=\r\nage price of $272.96.                 Tuesday, July 10, 2001        Ghost o=\r\nf Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray Davis is following footsteps of=\r\n former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN M.W. MOORLACH  Mr. Moorla=\r\nch is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector.   A recent L.A. Times poll=\r\n found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers fr=\r\nom a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual cost=\r\ns for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that ever=\r\nything is fine. It is not.  The state has been spending an average of $57 m=\r\nillion, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now C=\r\nalifornia is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed =\r\non its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankr=\r\nuptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long befor=\r\ne the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face.  Tha=\r\nt's why I'm gnawed by this \"d?j? vu\" sensation. The similarities and parall=\r\nels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. H=\r\nere's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer Robert Citr=\r\non, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The \"expe=\r\nrts\" and the \"politicos\" were comfortable with the investment scheme.  No w=\r\nonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieti=\r\nes. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was i=\r\nnvesting and what his \"exit strategy\" would be. Guess what? The unexpected =\r\nhappened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of borrowing suddenl=\r\ny exceeded the revenues being generated.  It caused the investment pool to =\r\nimplode and Orange County taxpayers realized a $1.64 billion loss. In spite=\r\n of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he=\r\n ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, t=\r\nhe state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eli=\r\nminated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-ter=\r\nm contracts.  Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for =\r\nelectricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It d=\r\nepleted the available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are =\r\nimploding. In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis t=\r\no avoid or minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also his=\r\ntory.  It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of reta=\r\nil rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess=\r\n what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves!=\r\n Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in =\r\nthe light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and onl=\r\ny compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no Libertaria=\r\nn or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He has retu=\r\nrned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California=\r\n by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equ=\r\nitable way of refunding taxes, but has anyone ever thought up a more effici=\r\nent method? But, that's not all. He wants it back! Davis now wants to borro=\r\nw some $13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more ele=\r\nctricity at rates in excess of the retail prices! When does this train wrec=\r\nk in slow motion stop?  And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not wa=\r\nnt to raise rates last summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay o=\r\nff this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant uti=\r\nlity rate increase. The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davi=\r\ns is gone about his expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants t=\r\no purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say=\r\n \"no.\"  If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond=\r\n buyers will also say \"no,\" unless they receive an attractive interest rate=\r\n. Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just su=\r\nbscribed $800 million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis wa=\r\nlked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangi=\r\nble legacy to show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new school=\r\ns. No infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments.  Wasn't that Cit=\r\nron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the citizens of Cali=\r\nfornia will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. Over 15 years=\r\n it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, squandering =\r\nthe entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his =\r\nindecisiveness and lack of leadership!  It is so tragic that the perpetrato=\r\nr of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the \"blame=\r\n game.\" Orange County played the \"blame game,\" too. But it had obvious perp=\r\netrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount i=\r\nn retribution payments. I'm not so sure California will have a similar resu=\r\nlt.            Calpine's Los Medanos Energy Center Adds Needed Generation t=\r\no California Second New Major Base Load Generator for California        Jul=\r\ny 10, 2001      Second New Major Base Load Generator for California  SAN JO=\r\nSE, Calif., July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corporati=\r\non (NYSE: CPN) announced today that its 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Cen=\r\nter in Pittsburg, Calif. is providing needed electricity to California's st=\r\nrained power grid. Los Medanos is the second major combined-cycle facility =\r\nto be licensed and built in California in over a decade. Fueled by natural =\r\ngas, the facility is designed to add up to 555-megawatts of clean, reliable=\r\n electricity to California on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week availabil=\r\nity. As a cogeneration facility, the project also delivers electricity and =\r\nsteam to USS POSCO for use in industrial processing.  Governor Gray Davis a=\r\nnd Calpine CEO Peter Cartwright will hold a press conference Monday afterno=\r\non to commission the Los Medanos Energy Center and to recognize the support=\r\n of the local community, the construction and trades people, and numerous o=\r\nrganizations that helped develop the facility.  Cartwright said, \"We are co=\r\nmmitted to creating innovative energy solutions for California's growing po=\r\nwer market. Los Medanos exemplifies excellence in power generation-ratepaye=\r\nrs and the environment benefit as Calpine brings to California new energy r=\r\nesources like Los Medanos.\"  Los Medanos is the second of eleven announced =\r\nmodern, fuel-efficient energy centers Calpine is building in the State as p=\r\nart of a $6 billion energy initiative. Three additional facilities are unde=\r\nr construction, including an 880-megawatt facility in Pittsburg at Dow Chem=\r\nical's facility. By year-end 2005, Calpine expects to be generating 12,000 =\r\nmegawatts of clean, affordable electricity to help repower California.  Cal=\r\npine broke ground on the Los Medanos Energy Center in September 1999. More =\r\nthan 600 construction and trade personnel worked on the project over a 20-m=\r\nonth period. During the past several months, the project scheduled two ten-=\r\nhour shifts, seven days a week to get the plant operating as soon as possib=\r\nle in light of the energy crisis. And over the past several weeks, technica=\r\nl teams worked round the clock to complete the facility. The total cost of =\r\nconstruction is estimated to be approximately $350 million.  The Los Medano=\r\ns Energy Center is located in Pittsburg, Calif., in Contra Costa County adj=\r\nacent to the USS POSCO plant and is operated by a 22-member staff of highly=\r\n trained personnel.  As with all of Calpine's modern base load facilities, =\r\nLos Medanos uses combined-cycle design with natural gas-fired turbines in c=\r\nombination with a steam turbine to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. Advance=\r\nd emissions control technology enables Calpine to reduce certain emissions =\r\nby more than 90 percent.  Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is=\r\n dedicated to providing customers with reliable and competitively priced el=\r\nectricity. Calpine is focused on clean, efficient, natural gas-fired genera=\r\ntion and is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy. Ca=\r\nlpine has launched the largest power development program in North America. =\r\nTo date, the company has approximately 34,000 megawatts of base load capaci=\r\nty and 7,200 megawatts of peaking capacity in operation, under construction=\r\n, pending acquisitions and in announced development in 29 states, the Unite=\r\nd Kingdom and Canada. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly trade=\r\nd on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information=\r\n about Calpine, visit its Website at www.calpine.com.

The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving=\r\n the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which=\r\n the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab=\r\nout $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it =\r\nwould seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although e=\r\nlectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis =\r\nthat has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be=\r\n resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should hav=\r\ne cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an ac=\r\ncounting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly=\r\n overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2=\r\n0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators=\r\n say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's es=\r\ntimates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlem=\r\nent talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the fed=\r\neral agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c=\r\nomprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would =\r\nrecommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti=\r\nary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he w=\r\nould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under =\r\nfederal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and =\r\nreasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year th=\r\nat California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began=\r\n imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o=\r\nf past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains =\r\nuncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than=\r\n for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 bil=\r\nlion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California sho=\r\nuld have paid for power since last September, when the commission began mon=\r\nitoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroact=\r\nively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated t=\r\nhat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is=\r\n closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar=\r\nd by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recom=\r\nmending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''mayb=\r\ne a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju=\r\ndge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled=\r\nged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that wha=\r\ntever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option o=\r\nf seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' s=\r\naid Michael Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talk=\r\ns. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder =\r\nin the courts.''  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did =\r\nnot provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue=\r\n generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generato=\r\nrs, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said,=\r\n speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California=\r\n .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se=\r\nttlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 m=\r\nillion. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w=\r\nould result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their =\r\noffer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they no=\r\nw hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t=\r\nhreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol=\r\nlars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially press=\r\ned utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.  ''We =\r\nremain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that =\r\nwill put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said Brent Bailey, vice=\r\n president and general counsel of Duke Energy.       Financial  Energy Refu=\r\nnd Talks Fail In Calif.; Federal Agency's Judge To Propose Settlement Peter=\r\n Behr    07/10/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001, =\r\nThe Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  California consumers were over=\r\ncharged by as much as $1 billion by electricity suppliers since October, a =\r\nfederal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power=\r\n suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges.  Gov. Gray=\r\n Davis (D) and California power officials wanted $8.9 billion in refunds da=\r\nting back to May 2000, when the state's energy crisis began.  A group of ge=\r\nnerating companies headed by units of Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc=\r\n. and Williams Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, goi=\r\nng back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg=\r\ner amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  \"The nu=\r\nmbers were too far apart,\" Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal=\r\n Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed neg=\r\notiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i=\r\nmprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f=\r\nigure.  Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec=\r\nted to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  \"A lot=\r\n of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't,\" Wagner told =\r\nreporters. \"There's an old southern saying,\" said the 72-year-old Tennessea=\r\nn. \"You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.\"  He declin=\r\ned to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California offic=\r\nials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his=\r\n own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula=\r\n essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul=\r\nd have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel c=\r\nosts and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refun=\r\nd, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considera=\r\nble weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier=\r\n this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first =\r\nthree months of this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.  Facing=\r\n increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members =\r\nappointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's pow=\r\ner prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholes=\r\nale power transactions in California and 10 other western states. Wagner pa=\r\ntterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.  The nation's wealthies=\r\nt state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas =\r\nprices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $7 billion in 1999 to=\r\n an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not retreat from reco=\r\nrd levels until last month.  Davis's top aides quickly claimed vindication =\r\nyesterday.  \"We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are goin=\r\ng to be in the multiple billions,\" said Michael Kahn, chairman of the Calif=\r\nornia Independent System Operator, the state's power grid manager.  Kahn no=\r\nted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against t=\r\nhe principal energy suppliers, most of them headquartered outside the state=\r\n. The companies had insisted on being released from the state's legal claim=\r\ns as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the negotiations=\r\n.  \"We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for =\r\nthe remainder,\" Kahn said. \" California will get its $8.9 billion.\"  But th=\r\ne state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief market moni=\r\ntor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state =\r\ngenerators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion=\r\n using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 bill=\r\nion goal.  Duke Energy is \"very pleased'' by Wagner's action, said Brent Ba=\r\niley, vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company. Th=\r\ne generators, however, repeated their claims that Davis is trying to make t=\r\nhem scapegoats for the state's failed electricity deregulation plan.  The m=\r\najor generators, in a statement yesterday, said they had delivered only 20 =\r\nmillion megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used fro=\r\nm October 2000 to last May. (A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750=\r\n homes.)  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped la=\r\nrge profits, the generators said.  \"The refunds sought by California would =\r\nsend a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers: when prices are l=\r\now and surpluses exist, you face a steep downside; when scarcity develops a=\r\nnd prices rise we will take away all upside [profit]. No one will invest [i=\r\nn California power facilities] in that climate,\" the generators' statement =\r\nsaid. \"The power supply shortage thus will continue without relief.\"   http=\r\n://www.washingtonpost.com  Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com          =\r\n  Economy   California and Energy Companies Miss Deadline By Richard B. Sch=\r\nmitt    07/10/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Copyright (c) 2001, =\r\nDow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company=\r\n executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of =\r\ndisputed California electricity charges, as a federal mediator overseeing t=\r\nhe talks suggested the state's demand was excessive.  Cautioning that he ha=\r\ndn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrati=\r\nve law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put the level of =\r\npotential refunds at \"hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion doll=\r\nars.\" He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies it=\r\ns insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.  Mr. Wagner said he would =\r\nrecommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from Octobe=\r\nr -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line=\r\n with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That decision alone would shav=\r\ne $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.  Mr. Wagner, who is expected to i=\r\nssue formal findings in the next few days, said he would recommend that the=\r\n FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring=\r\n refunds.  The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals late=\r\nr between energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcha=\r\nrging for power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers=\r\n indicated a willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two \"parti=\r\nal\" settlements were in the works.  Yet, absent any such solution, the over=\r\ncharge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to b=\r\ne resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings, which could drag=\r\n on for months or even years.  The negotiations began June 25, with a deadl=\r\nine set for midnight last night. But late yesterday, participants indicated=\r\n they were billions of dollars apart, with basic differences over everythin=\r\ng from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered=\r\n the talks, could enforce a deal because of the industry's questions about =\r\nthe reach of the agency's authority.  \"We haven't reached a settlement. We =\r\nreally haven't come close,\" said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli=\r\nant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay Califor=\r\nnia about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight. That is more than=\r\n a third of the Houston company's operating profit during the relevant peri=\r\nod, he said, although far shy of the more than $375 million California soug=\r\nht from Reliant.  Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 mill=\r\nion to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the =\r\nagency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwate=\r\nr, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito=\r\nring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some com=\r\npanies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $12=\r\n4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu=\r\nary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER=\r\nC members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to =\r\nact quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda=\r\ny, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at the sett=\r\nlement, declared he was \"gratified\" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they v=\r\nalidated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rej=\r\nected at the talks' outset. \"We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of=\r\n refunds and we'll get back lots of money,\" he said, adding that what the s=\r\ntate doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power genera=\r\ntors, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as \"ludicrous\" and =\r\n\"unsound,\" felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. \"The state came away=\r\n with far less than its expectations,\" said Robert Loeffler, an attorney fo=\r\nr a unit of AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. \"The common expectation now is that=\r\n any refunds will be way below this $9 billion.\"=09","To":["mday@gmssr.com"],"cont_length":24145,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 14:35:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<9848718.1075851633487.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Energy Issues"},{"content":"Thanks.","To":["sgovenar@govadv.com"],"cont_length":1,"Week_number":"27","Date":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 14:50:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<3401476.1075851635151.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Legislation Schedule"},{"content":"Let's go ahead and do a call.

But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  \n\nAgencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  \n\nReceiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  \n\nThe total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  \n\nIn addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.  \n\n\n\nThe Sellers  \n\nThe following is a partial list of companies that sold electricity into the  California spot power market from Jan. 18 through May 31.

It's going to get very interesting from here.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 07/10/2001 04:11 PM -----\n\n\n\t\"Simpson, Rick\" <Rick.Simpson@asm.ca.gov> 07/10/2001 04:12 PM \t   To: \"'dhunter@s-k-w.com'\" <dhunter@s-k-w.com>, \"Simpson, Rick\" <Rick.Simpson@asm.ca.gov>  cc: \"'Barbara Barkovich (E-mail)'\" <brbarkovich@earthlink.net>, \"'Dominic DiMare (E-mail)'\" <dominic.DiMare@calchamber.com>, \"'Dorothy Rothrock (E-mail)'\" <drothrock@cmta.net>, \"'John Fielder (E-mail)'\" <fieldejr@sce.com>, Gary.Schoonyan@sce.com, \"'Phil Isenberg (E-mail)'\" <isenberg@hmot.com>, \"'Jeff Dasovich (E-mail)'\" <jdasovic@enron.com>, \"'Keith McCrea (E-mail)'\" <kmccrea@sablaw.com>, \"'Linda Sherif (E-mail)'\" <lys@a-klaw.com>, \"'Linda Sherif (E-mail 2)'\" <lysherif@yahoo.com>, \"'John White (E-mail)'\" <vjw@cleanpower.org>, Ann.Cohn@sce.com, \"Mike Kahl (E-mail)\" <mikahl@ka-pow.com>  Subject: RE: Final Legislative Language\t\n\n\n\nYou all are awesome.

The level of=\r\n direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there =\r\nis substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce=\r\nss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of =\r\nan optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to=\r\n San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi=\r\ntments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate dir=\r\nect access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E disc=\r\nusses below how to provide for this coordination.=20\r\n\r\nAs the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections wi=\r\nll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That =\r\nstability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access=\r\n and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct =\r\naccess is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the=\r\n summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direc=\r\nt access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly hal=\r\nf. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a=\r\n result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avo=\r\nid paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspe=\r\nnd direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, th=\r\ne legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, a=\r\nnd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effe=\r\nct of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause larg=\r\ne quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly.=20\r\n\r\nThese events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce=\r\nss and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an=\r\n open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect=\r\nions take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided inf=\r\normation on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggrega=\r\ntion) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment =\r\nperiod would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is schedul=\r\ned to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitmen=\r\nts to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller cu=\r\nstomers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the =\r\nuse of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the informatio=\r\nn it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of =\r\nover- or under-commitment.=20\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of se=\r\nrvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, a=\r\nnd, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce=\r\nss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to l=\r\nimit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a=\r\nn exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai=\r\nned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c=\r\nustomers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commo=\r\ndity service to departing customers.

Stake\n\nAugust 23, 2001 \n\nDow Jones Newswires\n\n\nCalif Power Consultant Failed To Reveal Energy Co. Stake\n\n\nBy JASON LEOPOLD\n\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\nLOS ANGELES -- A top energy consultant hired by to negotiate long-term power contracts for the state of California failed to disclose that he held stock in a company with which the state signed a $1 billion power supply pact last month, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nVikram Budraja filed an amended financial disclosure form Aug. 13 listing holdings of between $2,000 and $10,000 in stock in ScottishPower (SPI), whose subsidiary PacifiCorp Power Marketing signed a $1 billion, 10-year power contract with the state Department of Water Resources on July 6.\n\nBudraja failed to disclose the information in a form he filed in July, after energy consultants hired by Gov. Gray Davis came under fire for failing to file routine financial disclosure forms.\n\nBudraja's August economic disclosure form states that he sold his ScottishPower shares July 30 on the advice of his lawyer. He purchased the shares \"pre-96,\" according to the form.\n\nDavis's office has sent a copy of Budraja's amended filing to the state's Fair Political Practices Committee for review, said Bill Kissinger, Deputy Legal Affairs adviser for Davis.\n\nThe FPPC is conducting an investigation into a handful of the DWR's consultants who held stock in energy companies while working on behalf of the state buying power and negotiating contracts, Kissinger said.\n\nThe DWR, which is handling the job of buying power in lieu of California's insolvent utilities, said Budraja didn't negotiate the contract with PacifiCorp. The department disclosed the contract on Aug. 17.\n\nStephen Kaufman, a lawyer representing the Electric Power Group and Budraja, also said Budraja didn't help negotiate the contract. Kaufman added that Budraja's ScottishPower holdings were tied up in an IRA and that Budraja hadn't even realized he held stock in the company until a review of his financial records was undertaken recently.\n\n\"A decision was made upon reviewing all of Mr. Budraja's assets to disclose this to the public given all the activities going on and the press accounts,\" Kaufman said. \"The signing of the contract was of no consequence in deciding whether or not it should be sold. This was a very small holding that was part of an IRA purchased prior to 1996. He did not remember or realize he had this holding until after this situation blew up and took a look at all of his holdings.\"\n\n     Political Battle Continues\n\nBudraja included the following comment with his renewed filing:\n\n\"The information contained in the two previously filed form 700s was provided pursuant to a series of instructions provided by the Department of Water Resources starting on June 15, 2001, that my disclosure should reflect the facts that existed on the date you first began working for the California Energy Resources Scheduling,\" Budraja wrote, referring to the Department of Water Resources' power-buying arm. \"This amended form is filed to list information not previously provided based upon consultation with and advice of legal counsel regarding the disclosure required by the Political Reform Act.\"\n\nThe disclosure is the latest in a battle over possible conflicts of interest waged by Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis, a Democrat, next year for governor.\n\nJones began pressing consultants hired by Davis' administration in July to disclose their shareholdings in energy companies. Once they did, Jones asked federal and state regulators to investigate possible insider trading and conflicts of interest.\n\nBudraja, a former Edison International (EIX) vice president, is one of the state's two main power-contract negotiators. Electric Power Group is under contract to plan and execute the DWR's power purchases and to help coordinate between the agency and other state offices. His firm has 10 employees under contract to the DWR. Electric Power Group is to receive $6.2 million for those services through Dec. 31, 2002.\n\nAs reported, investigators with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Budraja's shareholdings. The consultant has confirmed receiving a letter from the SEC informing him of the inquiry and asking him to supply information regarding his investments as of Jan. 1.\n\nIn July, Budraja disclosed holding in Edison International and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), both of which he sold after he began working for the state.\n\nThe state's contract with PacifiCorp was negotiated by Richard Ferreira, the former Sacramento Municipal Utility District executive, and a representative from Navigant consulting, said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.\n\nFerreira was fired in late July because he held stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN) while negotiating long-term contracts with the company, according to Davis' office.\n\nThe Republican leadership in the state Legislature has called for oversight hearings into the state's $43 billion in long-term power contracts, as well as its spot-market purchases. The Democratic majority has yet to respond to the request.\n\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n  _____  \n\nURL for this Article:\nhttp://interactive.wsj.com/archive/retrieve.cgi?id=DI-CO-20010823-007277.djm\n\n  _____  \n\n\nCopyright ? 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED \n\n\nTHE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY\nWHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.\n \nThe cover letter states as follows:  \n \n\"This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several\nways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from\nSeptember 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,\n2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed\ndirect access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power\nfrom electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.\nSeveral other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. \n \nAssembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires\nthat direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no\nlonger supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated\nelectricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine the\neffective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm\nto customers and to resolve potential conflict, parties should comment on:\n(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including all\ntransactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1X\nif it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,\n2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriate\ndate for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.\nThose comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for\nthose who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September\n4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date.\"\n \nThe specific wording in the Decision is:\n \n\"The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until\nDWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should\nbe suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;\nand the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company\n(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest of\nproviding cost stability for current direct access customers, written\ncontracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from the\nsuspension for the initial term of the contracts.\"\n \nIt also provides that:\n\n\"In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need for\nthe Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as\nsoon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to the\nparties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice that\ndirect access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commission\npostponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do not\nchange the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation was\nintroduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February\n1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants have\nnow had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wish\nto reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 in\nthe hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this\nswitch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service\nfrom the utility.\" \n\nThe decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues\nwhich would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,\ndisposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.  I presume we will want to file in\nstrong opposition.  Suggestions on strategy?

The volunteers, who will wear black and yellow armbands for easy identification, will meet with lawmakers and report on legislative developments to the media and to community groups, said spokesman Doug Heller. \n\n\n   \n\n\"We want politicians to know they are being watched and that an Edison bailout is unacceptable,\" Heller said. \n\nA bill is currently being heard by an Assembly committee to rescue SoCal Ed by allowing it to issue up to $2.9 billion in bonds backed by ratepayer revenue.

I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.\n\n1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an \"Out Of Market\" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.\n\n2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (\"OOM\") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  \n\n3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.\n\n4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.\n\n5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)\n\n6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.\n\n7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and \"the Friday Burrito,\" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.\n\n8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito: \n\n\"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, \"The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets.\" \n\n9.

Here is an e-mail from the intrepid and vigilant Kit Blair, in Volume Management, who first brought this scam to my attention.\n\n -----Original Message----- \nFrom:   Blair, Kit  \nSent:   Thursday, August 23, 2001 3:42 PM \nTo:     Hall, Steve C. (Legal) \nCc:     DL-Portland Volume Mgmt \nSubject:        487 Revelation \n\nSteve, \n        Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.   \n\n-Kit","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","pat.shortridge@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com"],"cont_length":1773,"Week_number":"34","Date":"Tue, 28 Aug 2001 11:23:43 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<20215066.1075852610482.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts"},{"content":"My understanding is that we'll all try to attend.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: \"Mara, Susan\" <Susan.J.Mara@ENRON.com>@ENRON \nSent: Tue 8/28/2001 1:23 PM \nTo: sgovenar@govadv.com; Hedy Govenar; Bev Hansen; Susan J Mara; Jeff Dasovich; Kaufman, Paul \nCc: Joseph Alamo \nSubject: RE: Black Caucus\n\n\n\nI think that day is fine from a childcare perspective.

Potential assistants should expect to take primary responsibility for coverage on lower capitalization companies ASAP and migrate upwards as market conditions improve and research coverage is broadened (within a few months). The position would be based in Portland, OR.\n \nPacific Crest is a full service investment bank focused on the Internet and communications technology companies. The Bank has approximately 100 professionals with primary offices in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest also has offices in Seattle, San Francisco (primarily IB operations), and Boston (Sales and Trading).

It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.\nThe proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.\nAssignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).\nThe proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much \"headroom\" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.\nGiven the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.\nAll that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate (\"ORA\") buy into the idea.\nI'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.\nOn the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.\n\nSome preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tEtringer, Michael  \nSent:\tTuesday, August 28, 2001 10:44 AM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nCc:\tParquet, David; Calger, Christopher F.; Tribolet, Michael\nSubject:\tTiming for QF meeting with Edison\n\nJeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.

(Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  \n\nThe proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.

A year ago, about 30 percent of Calpine's power was\n> under contract, he said.\n>\n> Calpine, one of the largest U.S. power-plant builders, has been buying\n> natural-gas fields to supply its power plants, spending about $1.9 billion\n> from March last year to July to boost gas reserves to 1.5 trillion cubic\n> feet. It also has bought gas in futures markets to help fix margins on\n> electricity sales, Macias said.\n>\n> ``The California crisis, while not desired, has been a tremendous\n> opportunity,'' Macias said. ``Calpine may be the only player emerging from\n> the crisis with no overhang issues. We are emerging stronger than ever.''\n>\n> The long-term contracts have an average ``spark spread,'' or the\ndifference\n> between revenue and the cost of fuel to generate the electricity, of\n$26.50\n> a megawatt-hour, Macias said. One megawatt-hour is enough energy to light\n> 750 typical California homes for an hour.\n>\n> California has $43 billion in long-term energy contracts with Calpine and\n> other generators. The state's Department of Water Resources began buying\n> power on behalf of its three investor-owned utilities in January after the\n> two largest, owned by PG&E Corp. and Edison International, became\ninsolvent\n> buying power for more than they were allowed to charge customers.\n>\n> San Jose, California-based Calpine expects $16 billion in revenue over the\n> next 20 years from contracts with the department, PG&E, the city of San\n> Francisco, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other agencies.\n> Most of the contracts are for 10 years or less.\n>\n> PG&E Payment\n>\n> Calpine is owed $267 million by PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's\n> largest utility, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April after\n> accruing $9 billion in power-buying losses. Calpine expects to be paid\nwith\n> interest after Pacific Gas submits its reorganization plan later this\nyear,\n> Lisa Bodensteiner, Calpine's general counsel, said on the call.\n>\n> Calpine isn't owed money by Edison's Southern California Edison, which is\n> negotiating a rescue plan with state lawmakers to keep California's No. 2\n> utility out of bankruptcy, Macias said.\n>\n> Shares of Calpine fell 45 cents to $33.25.

More than a century ago, Marcus Daly turned a bet on a copper vein under Butte into the giant Anaconda Co. The gambling game Keno was invented here for bored miners. In 1974, stuntman Evel Knievel, a Butte native, made headlines betting -- unsuccessfully -- that he could jump the Snake River Canyon on his rocket-powered motorcycle.\n\nNow, Bob Gannon, another Butte native, and chairman and chief executive of Montana Power Co., is betting he can pull off his own breathtaking stunt: He plans to turn his staid 89-year-old utility into a high-tech high-flier.\n\n [gannon] <http://interactive.wsj.com/public/resources/images/Gannon_Bob-FM23808212001221914.gif>\n\nIn one dizzying two-year stretch, the Butte-based utility has sold just about all its assets -- power plants, transmission lines, dams, gas, coal and oil fields -- pouring much of the $1.6 billion take into a coast-to-coast fiber-optic network. By the end of this year, Mr. Gannon boasts, Montana Power will have 26,000 miles of fiber in the ground, a new corporate name, Touch America, and it will be among the nation's largest half-dozen broadband companies.\n\nSo far, Mr. Gannon's gamble seems to be following the same trajectory as Mr. Knievel's. The joke around here is that at least Mr. Knievel wore a parachute.\n\nIndeed, while plenty of companies have been hammered by the telecommunications bust, few have taken a more severe beating than Montana Power. Under Mr. Gannon's leadership, the company sold out of the energy business just as electric rates were taking off and bought into broadband as it was poised to tank. Now, only 5% to 10% of Touch America's fiber is being used.\n\nMr. Gannon's makeover of the venerable utility has touched off warfare here, pitting Montana Power against regulators, investors, consumer advocates and its own former corporate customers. The company's stock, which hit a high of $65 a share five days after Mr. Gannon announced his decision to dump the utility business in March of last year, has spiralled downward since. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, it was at $7.90.\n\nThe decision by Montana Power's board to authorize a 6.6 million share buyback during the plunge didn't boost Mr. Gannon's image either. The spree cost the company $204.8 million; the purchased shares are now valued at about $52 million.\n\nBut perhaps most galling to Montanans are the huge gains made by PPL Corp., the Pennsylvania utility that bought Montana Power's electric generating plants. PPL has sold nearly a third of the plants' power out-of-state at a huge markup, producing record profits. Meanwhile, state utility regulators, angry at Mr. Gannon's refusal to share proceeds of the asset sale with customers, have locked his company into a painful contract: Montana Power is required to continue supplying power to its 288,000 customers until 2007, even though it owns no more power plants. That has forced the company to purchase electricity from PPL. Montana Power, which is barred from raising customer rates, has been losing money on the transactions.\n\nLong, Expensive Fight\n\nThe five-member utility commission could decide to let Montana Power boost its rates next year. But the high price of providing power has already drained the company's coffers. To cut back on its expenses, Montana Power agreed in June to pay $62.5 million to cancel the last year-and-a-half of a long-term supply contract with one of its biggest commercial customers, Butte-based Advanced Silicon Materials.\n\nLast week, in an unusual lawsuit filed in state district court in Helena, eight Montana Power shareholders charged the utility, its board, and its senior executives and consultants with a \"breach of fiduciary duty\" for failing to get shareholders' approval for the company's transformation. The suit seeks a rollback of Mr. Gannon's makeover, charging the effort has cost shareholders $3 billion. It also seeks to return to shareholders what it calls PPL's \"illegal\" gains from power sales.\n\n\"We're trying to salvage the pension funds of thousands of Montanans who are wrapped up in this company,\" says Frank Morrison Jr., a former state Supreme Court justice and one of the attorneys filing the suit. Six of the state's largest law firms collaborated on the suit, Mr. Morrison says, \"because we anticipate a long, expensive fight.\" Montana Power would not discuss its reasons for not seeking shareholder approval for the makeover but says it has done nothing wrong and will defend itself vigorously.\n\nAll this has tattered Mr. Gannon's reputation as a hometown genius. Just last year, Wall Street analysts and media praised his bold makeover plan. He was cheered during the company's annual meeting, a folksy conclave held at Butte's Mother Lode Theater that is part business session, part homecoming party. More than a third of the company's registered shareholders live in Montana.\n\nBut this year, angry shareholders and customers have picketed the company's headquarters, and Web sites are springing up across the state to rally voters to punish Montana Power. Earlier this month, Michelle Lee, a Democratic legislator from Livingston, launched Dumpthedeal.com (www.dumpthedeal.com <http://www.dumpthedeal.com/>1), a Web site urging a referendum to repeal deregulation of the electric industry in Montana. She says the site drew more than 1,000 visitors in its first two weeks.\n\n\"A lot of people here just can't believe what's happened to Montana Power,'' says Ralph McCaughy, who retired from the company's data-processing department three years ago. Mr. McCaughy, who is 62 years old and has throat cancer, says he and his wife, Jean, had planned to use some of their Montana Power shares and dividends to buy a new car to replace their wheezy 1993 Honda and take a trip to Hawaii. Montana Power stopped paying dividends last year as part of the makeover.\n\nMr. McCaughy says his spending plans are on hold. \"I don't know whether Gannon and the bunch running the company couldn't stop themselves or what,\" he says.\n\nEnduring Hecklers\n\nThese days, strangers sometimes blow raspberries and heckle Mr. Gannon during his daily two-block trek from his office to Gamer's, a local luncheonette that features a Butte specialty -- pork-chop sandwiches. The fact that Montana Power -- always one of the state's most powerful political forces -- led the lobbying drive for deregulation in the state hasn't helped his popularity. Deregulated electricity prices soared so high here last summer that several large Montana companies that had elected to buy power on the open market closed or cut back operations.\n\nSteven Walsh, president of Montana Resources, which operates part of Anaconda's open-pit mine in Butte, says he shut the mine and laid off 322 people last summer after his electricity bill jumped to $627 a megawatt hour from $26 an hour in a week. Prices have begun to come down, but the mine is still shut.\n\n\"I don't hold any animosity toward Bob Gannon,\" Mr. Walsh says. \"But around here I guess the general feeling is they made a big mistake.\"\n\nDespite the company's battered stock price, some Wall Street analysts say they still have hope for the transformation, and they note that Touch America -- which expects to have $1.6 billion in assets, including $350 million in cash -- has a stronger balance sheet than most of its telecom competition.\n\nDefending His Position\n\nMr. Gannon denies rumors that he has been punched out in several Butte bars, but Montana Power's Internet message boards are sizzling with rants by angry investors threatening to show up at this year's Sept. 14 annual meeting with tar, feathers, or worse.\n\n\"Bob's a decent human being and I still like the guy,\" says Paul Cote, the owner of Gamer's. \"But I have heard people bad-mouthing him. There's a lot of people upset with him right now.\"\n\nMr. Gannon, who can see the house where he grew up -- beyond the Hock-It-To-Me pawnshop -- from his office window, defends his makeover decision. Energy deregulation during the late 1990s doomed smaller regional utilities such as Montana Power, he says, while fiber optics was becoming a glamour industry. The company had begun laying fiber-optic lines in the 1980s. As the business began to take off in the 1990s, Mr. Gannon and others believed they had a solid head start.\n\n\"There's a lot of second-guessing taking place now,\" he says. \"But we were the ones sitting in the chair, and we made a decision that was absolutely correct and justified.\"\n\nOthers blame Montana Power's problems on overreaching by Mr. Gannon and the utility's management, as well as on strong salesmanship by Goldman Sachs, Montana Power's investment bankers. Critics of the deal have suggested that Montana Power's 11-member board -- stocked with seven Montanans -- might not have fully appreciated the risks and challenges of the fiber-optic business.\n\n\"They were intoxicated by their stock price and Wall Street was telling them, 'Hey, you're on a roll,' \" says Robert Anderson, a Public Service Commission member. \"These were utility guys. What did they know about the telecommunications business?\"\n\nMr. Gannon and other senior officials who were part of the Policy Leadership Group, a Montana Power internal decision-making team, say that until shortly before last year's makeover announcement they hadn't decided to turn Montana Power into a telecom. At first, Mr. Gannon says, the group had been \"comfortable\" with a more limited step: an initial public offering of the Touch America unit. The group also considered spinning off Touch America to Montana Power's shareholders or continuing to build it up within the company, he says.\n\nGoldman Sachs, which has worked with the utility for 17 years, urged the company's management to drop its power business entirely, company officials say. Goldman specialists from New York, Los Angeles and Chicago made more than 100 visits to Butte, camping at the Copper King Motel and advising the utility executives on their options. As the discussions went on, company officials say, divestiture of the power business seemed the most logical choice. Mr. Gannon and others say Goldman's bankers warned that the IPO market was losing its luster and urged them to sell their power-making assets quickly to get the best price.\n\nMatt Darnell, a Goldman managing director who advised Montana Power on its move toward telecommunications, declines to give specifics of Goldman's recommendations to either the policy group or Montana Power's board. \"There were numerous options explored,\" he says, \"but we certainly supported the thoughtful and deliberative approach the board took.\"\n\nOf the subsequent downward turn of events, Mr. Darnell says: \"The telecommunications industry has taken a turn no one expected.\"\n\nFor its advice, Goldman will get 2.5% of the gross payout from the asset sale, or about $14.2 million, a Montana Power spokesman says. Goldman officials say they are no longer advising Montana Power on its business plan.\n\nMr. Gannon scoffs at the notion that his company made the wrong move. In a strongly worded letter last week, he urged shareholders to approve the final pieces of his makeover plan at the Sept. 14 annual meeting. He warned that if the shareholders rejected the measures, Montana Power's board would seek to accomplish the divestiture of the utility business through unspecified \"other methods.\"\n\nDemand for fiber-optic networks will regain strength before long, Mr. Gannon says. When it does, Touch America could have an advantage over its debt-laden competition. Mr. Gannon says his company will emerge as one of the telecom industry's strongest national players, with no debt and a state-of-the-art technology.\n\n\"There are a lot of suggestions in watering holes around this state that Goldman was flying around the West looking for a bunch of guys to dupe and that we were a bunch of rubes from Montana who got taken in,\" he says. \"That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard.\"\n\n  _____  \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Guerrero, Janel \nSent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 5:18 PM\nTo: Shapiro, Richard; Palmer, Mark A.

The Sacramento Bee <http://www.sacbee.com/about_us/legal>=20\r\n\r\n\r\nDan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m=\r\nemory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Published Aug. 29, 2001)=20\r\n\r\nSenate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in =\r\ndecades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics=\r\n.=20\r\n\r\nThe measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray D=\r\navis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining=\r\n its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is =\r\nodd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll=\r\nars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20\r\n\r\nLiterally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated=\r\n around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea=\r\nched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util=\r\nity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft=\r\ner PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo=\r\nth utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l=\r\nast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta=\r\nil rates.=20\r\n\r\nEdison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a=\r\nspect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i=\r\ntself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad=\r\nvertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi=\r\nslature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to =\r\ndo.=20\r\n\r\nIs avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s=\r\nuggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin=\r\nancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi=\r\nng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft=\r\ner bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str=\r\nong as PG&E's.=20\r\n\r\nThe dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal=\r\nly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians=\r\n do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E=\r\ndison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd=\r\ns. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou=\r\nt for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme =\r\nbecause it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed =\r\nunder state control.=20\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, or=\r\ndinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making suc=\r\nh a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would Davis=\r\n put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition =\r\nthat exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g=\r\novernor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20\r\n\r\nHarvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a \"war room\" nea=\r\nr the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo=\r\nrts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St=\r\nreet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20\r\n\r\nAnother possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso=\r\nn. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bry=\r\nson was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong=\r\n ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b=\r\ny Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to la=\r\nunch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.=20\r\n\r\nThe most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christ=\r\nopher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. Bryson a=\r\nnd Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to tak=\r\ne command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch =\r\nthe red ink. Davis refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to=\r\n keep Edison out of bankruptcy court.=20\r\n\r\nWe may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison, but we will know, v=\r\nery soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.=\r\n=20\r\n\r\n  _____ =20\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.c=\r\nom <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----=20\r\nFrom: Shapiro, Richard=20\r\nSent: Wed 8/29/2001 5:52 AM=20\r\nTo: Dasovich, Jeff; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Mara, Susan=20\r\nCc:=20\r\nSubject: RE: SBX2 78 - Update\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgree- it's all on his shoulders.=20\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----=20\r\nFrom:   Dasovich, Jeff=20\r\nSent:   Wed 8/29/2001 12:31 AM=20\r\nTo:     Shapiro, Richard; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Mara, Susan=20\r\nCc:    =20\r\nSubject:        RE: SBX2 78 - Update=20\r\n\r\nWith Jim in Sacramento tomorrow, and hearings scheduled to discuss addition=\r\nal amendments, seems like a good opportunity for Jim to testify and knock s=\r\nome sense into the damn committee.

CALIFORNIA RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRA=\r\nM 25465. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the followi=\r\nng meanings. (a) \"Eligible renewable energy resource\" means an electric gen=\r\nerating facility or solar thermal energy system that reduces the consumptio=\r\nn of electricity through the use of renewable resources and generating faci=\r\nlity that meets all of the following criteria: (1) Uses wind, solar, geothe=\r\nrmal, or biomass as its primary fuel. (A) A solar thermal energy system tha=\r\nt reduces the consumption of electricity may be considered an eligible rene=\r\nwable energy resource. (B) Fuel cells using renewable fuels are an eligible=\r\n renewable energy resource. (2) Improves the resource diversity in the elec=\r\ntricity market that serves the state, and increases the reliability of the =\r\nstate's electricity system. The commission shall deem an electric generatin=\r\ng facility or solar thermal energy system to satisfy this requirement if it=\r\n meets any one of the following criteria: (A) It is located within or inter=\r\nconnected to the control area of the California Independent System Operator=\r\n, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or the Imperial Irrigation=\r\n District. (B) Its power is sold under a direct bilateral contract to a ret=\r\nail seller and its energy is scheduled into the control area of the Califor=\r\nnia Independent System Operator, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Po=\r\nwer, or the Imperial Irrigation District. (C) It meets other fact-based cri=\r\nteria established by the commission. seller and its energy is delivered to =\r\nend-use customers within the state. (b) \"Eligible existing renewable energy=\r\n resource\" means an electric generating facility that satisfies all criteri=\r\na in subdivision (a) and is in existence before January 1, 2001 September 2=\r\n6, 1996 . Any facility that sells its output to an electrical corporation u=\r\nnder a contract entered into prior to 1996 under the federal Public Utiliti=\r\nes Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-617) shall be considered an eli=\r\ngible existing resource. (c) \"Eligible new renewable energy resource\" means=\r\n output from an electric generating facility that satisfies all criteria in=\r\n subdivision (a) and meets at least one of the following criteria: (1) The =\r\nfacility commenced initial operation on or after January 1, 2001. September=\r\n 26, 1996. (2) The output represents incremental production from repowered =\r\nor refurbished existing facilities and project additions completed on or af=\r\nter January 1, 2001 September 26, 1996 , as measured by the production of k=\r\nilowatthours above the five-year average of the kilowatthours delivered fro=\r\nm the project during the five-year period ending December 31, 2000. kilowat=\r\nthours previously delivered from the project. Incremental output from repow=\r\nered or refurbished facilities sold to an electrical corporation under a co=\r\nntract entered into prior to January 1, 2001, that specifies fixed capacity=\r\n payments for the incremental output may not be considered an eligible new =\r\nrenewable energy resource. (3) The output represents incremental output abo=\r\nve levels specified in contracts for facilities defined in subdivision (b).\r\n\r\n=09=09=09=09=09Also: (c) \"Eligible new renewable energy resource\" means out=\r\nput from an electric generating facility that satisfies all criteria in sub=\r\ndivision (a) and meets at least one of the following criteria: (1) The faci=\r\nlity commenced initial operation on or after January 1, 2001.

I\nfollowed up with Keith prior to Appropriations and he was very disappointed\nthat he and Bill Leonard could not round up more votes. They knew the\nliberals would make a play and thought on a policy level they were better\noff pushing a better bill than allowing a bad bill to go through along party\nlines.  However, Republicans are well aware of the polling and think this\nissue is better left to the Democrats.  Perhaps the liberal play will\nenergize Republican members.  As for moving to the left, it did not appear\nas if Hertzberg was moving left because the amendments seemed to be offered\nwithout his consent which is why the hearing was stopped so abruptly.

The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. \n\"The drafts were not consistent,\" said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. \"Which one were we supposed to take seriously?\" \nThe energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. \nThe burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. \nDeregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. \nTo make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, \nmost direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. \nThe PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. \nBut by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. \nBusinesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with \"a significant number\" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. \n\"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should,\" said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. \nDaniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. \nAngelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. \n\"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill,\" Angelides said. \nState officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. \nFigures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. \nThe loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. \nBu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. \n\"What they're talking about doing,\" he said, \"is holding us hostage until they get what they want.\" \nE-mail Bernadette Tansey at btansey@sfchronicle.com <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>. \n?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> Page A - 21","To":["j..kean@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","kristin.walsh@enron.com","david.delainey@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","lamar.frazier@enron.com","kevin.keeney@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","scott.gahn@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","steve.swain@enron.com","john.lavorato@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","don.black@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","louise.kitchen@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","richard.shapiro@enron.com","wanda.curry@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","lynne.ruffer@enron.com","wade.stubblefield@enron.com"],"cont_length":982,"Week_number":"35","Date":"Mon, 3 Sep 2001 08:59:30 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<1895890.1075851608353.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"California Update 09.03.01--Debate Over Direct Access Heats Up"},{"content":"Thanks.

While the logistics look favorable\nfrom a time perspective, I'm not sure how promising it\nlooks from a \"wow\" that was a great class perspective.\n  \n\nClass held from 6:00 til 8:30 ish, w/ a 5 min break\n(we voted).\nHope you're havin fun on vacation!  Let me know if\nyou're going to go to this class, or want to catch up\non Tues durng break-\nCourtney \n\n \n\n\n--- \"Dasovich, Jeff\" <Jeff.Dasovich@ENRON.com> wrote:\n> Hey.

We are currently working on the Memorandum of Points and Authorities and anticipate sending a draft sometime tomorrow morning.  The Petition is based on the assumption that the Commission will adopt an order with retroactive application.  If the Commissions issues an Order consistent with the draft Interim Decision published today, then retroactivity will not be an issue and there wll be no need to seek judicial relief (at least on that ground). \n \nEnron Energy Services, Inc., is named as the Petitioner.  I am uncertain, however, whether this is the correct name or entity.\n \nThe Petition must be filed in the Supreme Court because the Legislature conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction on it when Public Utilities Code section 1768 was enacted.  The Petition does not  address the timeliness of the request for Supreme Court review.  Generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a Petition is timely and Section 1768 appears to require that an application for rehearing be denied before a Petition can be filed.  Since there will undoubtedly be an argument that the Petition is premature because there has been no application for a rehearing, the Points and Authorities (and probably the Petition) will discuss the timeliness of the Petition.  The exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine should control making the Petition timely.\n \nDan Douglass and I will be available for your 1 p.m. conference call.

Indicates where CMTA is on key bills working their way through California's wacked out Legislature.\n \nBest,\nJeff\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Geri L. Royer [mailto:groyer@cmta.net]\nSent: Thursday, September 06, 2001 4:30 PM\nTo: undisclosed-recipients\nSubject: CMTA Legislative Weekly - 09/06/01\n\n\nLegislative Weekly \nSeptember 6, 2001 \nIssue 35, Volume 3 \n\nA weekly publication from the \nCalifornia Manufacturers & Technology Association \ndetailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento\n\n\n\n\n\nELECTRICAL RESTRUCTURING \n\nSBX2 78 (Polanco D-Los Angeles and Sher D-Stanford).  CMTA supports this bill to allow Southern California Edison to collect $2.9 billion from customers to cover excess power costs incurred between May 2000 and January 2001.  While the debt can only be assessed against customers over 20kw in demand, provisions protecting the right to direct access and customer generation overcome our objections to the disproportionate spread of debt. The bill will be on the assembly floor this week. \n\nSBX2 27 (Bowen D-Marina del Rey).  This direct access bill remains a potential vehicle for reinstatement of direct access if SBX2 78 fails.  It failed to gain 2/3 votes in the Senate last June. CMTA did not support the bill, but remains willing to work with the author. \n\nSBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco).  CMTA supports this bill to create a separate revenue stream for payment of state energy revenue bonds, saving financing costs and simplifying the relationship between bonds and Department of Water Resources power contracts.  Passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability. \n\nSBX2 85 (Burton).  CMTA opposes this bill to repeal the sunset on the 10% rate discount for small commercial and residential customers that was created by AB 1890.  It passed out of Assembly EC&A. \n  \n\nNATURAL GAS EXIT FEES \n\nABX2 23 (Pescetti R-Rancho Cordova) requires non-core customers to make long-term projections regarding their firm service gas delivery needs, and would allow utilities to impose exit fees on non-core customers that do not later desire that firm service level. \n\nCMTA is opposed unless exit fees are removed. CMTA supports amendments to simply require the PUC to study the state's natural gas infrastructure to determine ways in which to expand capacity and increase competition.  The bill has not yet been set for hearing in Senate Energy Utilities and Communications. \n  \n\nELECTRICAL GENERATION - EMINENT DOMAIN \n\nABX2 35 (Vargas D-San Diego) authorizes the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority to exercise eminent domain to acquire generating facilities for 18-24 months.  Generators would be reimbursed a \"reasonable rental value\" as opposed to \"fair market value\" for facilities temporarily taken by the State.  Co-generation facilities are not exempt from the bill. \n\nCMTA is opposed and the bill may not move.  It is rumored that a Legislative Counsel opinion questions its constitutionality. The bill is currently in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee. \n  \n\nELECTRICAL GENERATION - STRICT LIABILITY \n\nABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno) provides that a resale or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility that reduces or discontinues service for solely economic reasons shall be held strictly liable for any damages proximately caused by that reduction or discontinuance.  \"Economic reasons\" is defined as the withholding of power for financial gain. Cogeneration is exempted from the bill. \n\nCMTA is opposed.  According to the author's staff, the measure will not be moved. The bill is in Assembly EC&A Committee. \n  \n\nELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS - ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES \n\nDespite rigorous debate on the Assembly Floor, on September 4 the Assembly adopted amendments to ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) which make the bill less onerous.  As amended, the measure makes it a wobbler for any person or entity, whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity, to exercise market power.  Market power is defined as the profitable maintenance of wholesale electricity prices above the prices that would occur in the wholesale market if that market were competitive.  The measure also allows the imposition of a fine of up to 10 percent of the violator's gross assets, upon conviction.  Felony penalties would apply to any person or entity that exercised market power during a Stage 1, 2 or 3 electrical emergency as determined by the Independent System Operator. \n\nThe September 4 amendments limit the bill to apply only to entities whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity that are able to exercise market power, and technically exempt qualifying facilities, co-generation, or self-generation.  The measure still includes onerous bounty-hunter provisions that authorize the Attorney General to pay a reward to any person who provides information that materially contributes to the imposition of a criminal fine.  The reward would be equal to 10% of the amount of the criminal fine collected by the AG, district attorney, or imposed by the court.  The measure likely will be taken up for a vote on the Assembly Floor sometime this week. \n  \n\nTAX - TRIAL DE NOVO \n\nAB 934 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys).  CMTA supports reforms to the property tax assessment appeal process, granting courts more power to overturn decisions that are anti-taxpayer. Assessors and counties claim that they will be manipulated into settling disputes too cheaply.  They obtained a Leg Counsel opinion declaring it to violate the California Constitution. \n\nThe bill is in Senate Rules.  CMTA is lobbying to ensure that it is sent to Appropriations and are lobbying members of that committee as well as members whose votes will be needed on the floor.  There is speculation that it is being held in Rules for leverage for a larger deal but it is more probable that it is a tactic to delay it until Hertzberg, the author, is no longer Speaker. \n  \n\nCORPORATE COUNSEL - PROTECTIVE ORDER/CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS \n\nAB 36 (Steinberg D-Sacramento), SB 11 (Escutia D-Whittier), AB 881 (Simitian D-Palo Alto).  CMTA opposes these bills to potentially expose proprietary information to the public.  SB 11 and AB 36 drive up litigation costs for defendants, leveraging higher settlements. AB 36 was \"Speakerized\" with the proviso that its substance would not go to the Governor, that SB 11 would be \"the vehicle\" and be revised into a more business friendly version.  Nevertheless, AB 36 (unchanged) has received a rule waiver allowing it to move in the Senate. \n\nCMTA is working on keeping the moderate Democrats in the Assembly from passing SB 11 and, if AB 36 does go to the Governor, in having them help with obtaining a veto.  CMTA is proposing AB 881 as an alternative though it is preferred that it not pass, and the trial lawyers would likely kill it.  At this point it appears that the moderates will stay with us but it appeared that way just before they caved-in in June. \n  \n\nEDUCATION - CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION \n\nAB 348 (Wright D-So. Central Los Angeles).  Several \"voc-ed\" bills designed to bolster this ailing system were passed by the Legislature this year including AB 348 which introduces mechanisms to elevate the academic standing of such courses.  Unfortunately, much of the funding for the voc-ed bills was cut out of the Budget. \n  \n\nEDUCATION - FACILITIES BOND \n\nAB 16 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys/Leonard R-San Bernardino) and SB 844 (Chesbro D-Arcata).  CMTA has declared support for this legislation to place a statewide school facilities bond on the ballot in 2002. Their scope spans K-College.  A conference committee is addressing the timing for the ballot (March vs. November), the amount and the allocation between K-12 and higher ed., and the allocation system to use among schools. \n  \n\nHOUSING \n\nCMTA supports two bills: AB 1284 (Lowenthal D-Long Beach) which provides property tax rewards to local jurisdictions within specified job centers (basically all of the major urban areas) which approve and build housing affordable to the local workforce.  SB 910 (Dunn D-Santa Ana) would impose sanctions on local jurisdictions which chronically fail to plan for their housing needs.  Both bills are in their second houses but are two-year projects.  Their terms will be negotiated during the interim. \n  \n\n$3.6 BILLION WORKERS' COMPENSATION BILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK \n\nThe Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers' compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers $3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a negotiating mood. \n\nThere was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a $1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB 71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers' costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or someone else. \n\nSteve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the governor's point person on workers' compensation said, \"the governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is comfortable with.\"  Smith dismissed the threat of labor turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else. \n\nNow that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at <http://www.cmta.net/press/082301work_comp.shtml> \n  \n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE \n\nSB 40 (Alarcon D-Sylmar) would increase unemployment insurance (UI) cost by over $3 billion over four years and includes several other onerous changes for employers.  The bill is in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on the suspense file and is opposed by CMTA. \n\nUnlike workers' compensation, UI has only two active parties of interest, labor and employers.  CMTA believes that employers are more vulnerable to a benefit increase in UI than workers' compensation because our maximum benefit level is the second lowest of all the states.  Therefore, employer representatives from CMTA, Cal-Chamber, Cal-Tax and Newspaper Publishers Association met with the author and labor to discuss a benefit increase and reforms to help offset some costs. The coalition has put together a proposal to counter SB 40. \n\nCMTA does not believe that the Governor would sign two benefit bills in the same year unless they were both negotiated and agreed upon by both labor and management.  According to the latest news, the Governor asked labor to choose and labor decided on the workers' compensation bill this session.  Therefore, no further action on UI will be taken this session. \n  \n\nSTORMWATER \n\nSB 72's author, Senator Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), and the bill sponsor, Santa-Monica-based Heal The Bay, agreed to remove all of the controversial minimum stormwater monitoring requirements affecting industrial facilities.  Most notably, the August 21 version deletes the proposed increase in stormwater sampling frequency and language requiring inclusion of additional constituents in each sampling event.  The current version also deletes all references to group monitoring - a regulatory program designed to streamline monitoring requirements for similar industrial facilities - which was originally prohibited.  These changes will spare individual facilities from thousands of dollars in increased stormwater monitoring costs.  All opposition has been removed, and the amendments lower the state's anticipated costs substantially.  The next hurdle is the state water board's renewal of the General Industrial Stormwater Permit next year. \n  \n\nSAFE DRINKING WATER & TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT \n\nThe Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65), SB 471 (Sher), was amended on July 5 to incorporate language developed by the Attorney General's office.  It is intended to help curb frivolous litigation, invited by lucrative bounty hunter provisions, that has overwhelmed the AG's resources.  Although advertised as a pro-business reform measure, the AG's proposal undermined the certainty of Prop. 65 settlements by allowing a district attorney, city attorney or private prosecutor to sue again for the same alleged offense.  The AG and Senator Sher have since agreed to remove that provision and make other lesser changes to avoid opposition from the business community.  The bill requires a 2/3 vote, which may not be achievable without a commitment from the AG to pursue further discussions toward more substantive reform. \n  \n\n2002 PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FORECAST \n\nWater Quality Standards - SB 469 (Alpert D-Coronado).  Held up in end of session politics, the bill advances consensus recommendations to improve regional implementation of federal Total Maximum Daily Load program.  Requires state water board to develop guidelines for regional boards on listing and de-listing water bodies and implementing TMDLs.  Would help focus state resources on legitimate water quality problems.  May move as urgency legislation in January, 2002. \n\nWastewater Discharge Offset Program - SB 815 (Machado D-Linden). Two-year vehicle to address the affects of legacy sources of pollution (e.g., abandoned mines) without bankrupting the discharger community.  Would provide less costly alternatives to end-of-the pipe permit limits, such as investing in upstream cleanup projects, with greater environmental benefits. \n\nEnvironmental Justice.  Under pressure from environmental activists, CARB is pursuing an aggressive agenda that does not track legislative direction.  Staff will present draft guidelines to the Board in December.  CARB's work will serve as a model for other Cal-EPA agencies required by SB 115 (Solis, 1999) and SB 89 (Escutia, 2000) to review their programs to address environmental justice concerns. \n\nToxic Injuries - SB 693 (Scott D-Altadena).  Two-year measure sponsored by trial lawyers to extend the statute of limitations for filing injury claims related to hazardous material exposures.  Anticipate an oppose position. \n\nBrownfields Cleanup Incentives - AB 1114 (Pescetti).

Stewart\n\nDate:      September 7, 2001\n\nRe:        Action Needed for Veto on Workers' Comp Bill (SB 71)\n\nThe Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers'\ncompensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on\nits way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers\n\n$3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to\nhelp offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the\nSenate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a\nnegotiating mood.\n\nThere was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor\n\nentered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a\n$1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous\nto employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton\nand his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press\nconference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a\nslap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB\n71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers'\ncosts).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured\nworkers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or\nsomeone else.\n\nSteve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the\ngovernor's point person on workers' compensation said, \"the\ngovernor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of\nlabor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion\nabout how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is\ncomfortable with.\"  Smith dismissed the threat of labor\nturning to someone else in the next election because the governor has\nstood with working Californians on issue after issue and he\nwould be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else.\n\nNow that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that\nemployers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on\nSB 71 go to the CMTA web site at http://www.cmta.net/issues/index.\n\n\nThe address for the Governor's Office is:\n\nThe Honorable Gray Davis\nGovernor of California\nState Capitol\nSacramento, CA  95814\n\nPhone: 916.445.2841\nFax: 916.445.4633\n\ngovernor@governor.ca.gov","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","e-mail<.scott@enron.com>"],"cont_length":404,"Week_number":"35","Date":"Sat, 8 Sep 2001 05:44:05 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<28217869.1075851608939.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Action Needed for Veto on Workers' Comp Bill (SB 71)"},{"content":"I'm starting to get concerned about this.

If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to \"compete\" with colleagues, Sue in particular.

I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year.

Officials deny price gouging.\n\nBy DOUG SMITH, RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ\nTimes Staff Writers\n\nSeptember 10 2001\n\nDuring the peak of California's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged, according to a newly completed independent audit.\n\nThe document, obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act, seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes.\n\nThe audit also undercuts efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private, out-of-state generating companies.\n\nFor months, DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15% above its costs.\n\nAs recently as July, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, repeated that assurance in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown.\n\nBut the audit findings show that DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56% last year under Freeman's stewardship.\n\nOverall, during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, records show that the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million. It says it is still owed $180 million.\n\nBeyond those higher profits, the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity.\n\nThey include a $34-million cut for the city's general fund--essentially a bonus for the utility's owner--and an additional $42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency's capital investments.\n\nThese overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators.\n\nIn effect, unsuspecting ratepayers across the state, whose utilities have been battered by debt, are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay.\n\nIn an interview late last week, Freeman defended those costs and DWP's profits, saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants.\n\nHe insisted that he had issued \"standing orders\" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15%.\n\n\"We made a fair amount of money. It was not price gouging,\" said Freeman, who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year.\n\nFreeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15%, then \"I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at [the] DWP.\"\n\nThe DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs, said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freeman's tenure.\n\n\"Maybe in hindsight,\" Wiggs said, \"it would have been better not to be so specific, but to say, 'Look we're gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers.' \"\n\nStill, Wiggs said, even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. \"We charged just and reasonable rates,\" he said, adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin.\n\nWiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity.\n\nConducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the study targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000. The results have provided critics with new ammunition.\n\n\"Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair,\" said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union. \"This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks, savings and loans and insurance companies--not a public agency.\"\n\nSen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the crisis, was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWP's profits were limited to 15%.\n\n\"This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny,\" he said after learning of the audit. \"It would be ironic if it turns out that the L.A. Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov. Davis' 'Texas Pirates,' \" said Thompson.\n\nThe DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the state's deregulation of electricity began to backfire, with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding.\n\nTo keep the power flowing, the DWP--which had opted out of deregulation--cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market.\n\nThis helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced.\n\nAt the same time, however, the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis, official reports would later show. Freeman repeatedly said the utility's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly, inefficient plants.\n\nBut the audit raises such serious questions about the DWP's behavior that the matter has spilled into the 2002 gubernatorial contest.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a possible Republican challenger to Davis, last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure.\n\nIn a letter to his successor, James K. Hahn, the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling.\n\nIf so, he said, the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated $180 million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales.\n\nA Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity.\n\n\"The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales,\" said Jaime de la Vega, a senior advisor to Riordan's campaign committee.\n\nFreeman, now squarely in the Davis camp, disputes Riordan's account. He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agency's pricing strategy.\n\nHe wanted to charge more, according to Freeman, in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, which were slipping into insolvency.\n\nFreeman described Riordan's view as: \"If we're gonna continue to sell it to them, we ought to get a lot of money. He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it.\"\n\nFor the most part, the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in California's haywire energy market. Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market, including his agency.\n\nBut according to a report by the state's grid operator, DWP was one of the most aggressive, along with the trading arm of BC Hydro, the government-owned utility in British Columbia.\n\nYet another report--this one by the state's power-buying agency--found that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe report said DWP charged an average of $292 per megawatt hour, asking more than many private generators.\n\nIt could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher.\n\nEven after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year, the DWP collected profits more than 40% higher than it claimed to have netted, records show.\n\nOverall, during the 13-month period audited, profits averaged 29%, double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving.\n\nAlthough Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers, Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities.\n\nOne key question is whether those agencies, like private suppliers, should be forced to refund excess profits.\n\nThe primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged.\n\nDWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction. But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities.\n\nThe leading proponent of that course is state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).\n\nIn a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month, he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are \"merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies.\"\n\nThe chairman of that committee, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead.\n\nFor information about reprinting this article, go to http://www.lats.com/rights/register.htm","To":["hgovenar@govadv.com","sgovenar@govadv.com","bhansen@lhom.com"],"cont_length":1643,"Week_number":"36","Date":"Mon, 10 Sep 2001 11:13:19 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<32731800.1075851609087.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: DWP Far Exceeded Profit It Reported"},{"content":"Thank you.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNoske, Linda J.  \nSent:\tMonday, September 10, 2001 3:37 PM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tReliant Protective Order\n\n\n\tDraft of transcribed message from Richard Sanders voice mail (Legal) to Rick Shapiro.

However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.\nFinally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.

Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)\nby Michael Rectenwald\n\n\n<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>\n \n \nAt this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the\nheart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in\nneed, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the\nimmediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to\naddress, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and\nspiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all\nsuffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let\nus suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of\nour fellow human beings.\n\nWhether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both\nhave arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding\nmembers, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.\nSome of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had \"arms, legs,\nand parts of people falling on our heads.\" Our nation is poorer, our lives\nare lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.\n\nWe who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find\nourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally\nbehind a leader who we know is not our leader, a \"leader\" who has, we\nbelieve, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our\nnation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger\ntowards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --\nunprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --\nis justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and\nabroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault\non our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst\nact of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.\nWe do not think that this attack under Bush's \"command\" represents a\nmeaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that\n\"inescapable web of mutuality\" that Martin Luther King referred to. There\nwas no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative\nconsequences in and for the world.\n\nThe Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to\nthe ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been\nexacerbated by the \"laissez faire\" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that\nClinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship\nthe situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,\nthe world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's\ninternational policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and\ntreaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at\nthe present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address\na deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable\npursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.\nLet's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to\nthose nearest us.\n\nTherefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some\nrestraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at\nthe ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.\nAccusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not\nhelp either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and\nalienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered\nfrom this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe\nharbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate \"captain.\"   Our\ncommitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a\ndeeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will\nthen be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the\nright place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best\ninterests of our nation at heart.\n\nLet us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our\nown, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too\nmuch to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares\ntoo much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human\nbeings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.\n\nSincerely, \n \n \nMichael Rectenwald\nFounder and Chair\nCitizens for Legitimate Government.\n\n \n  _____  \n\n\nTAKE ACTION NOW!

Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)\nby Michael Rectenwald\n\n\n<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>\n \n \nAt this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the\nheart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in\nneed, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the\nimmediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to\naddress, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and\nspiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all\nsuffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let\nus suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of\nour fellow human beings.\n\nWhether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both\nhave arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding\nmembers, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.\nSome of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had \"arms, legs,\nand parts of people falling on our heads.\" Our nation is poorer, our lives\nare lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.\n\nWe who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find\nourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally\nbehind a leader who we know is not our leader, a \"leader\" who has, we\nbelieve, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our\nnation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger\ntowards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --\nunprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --\nis justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and\nabroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault\non our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst\nact of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.\nWe do not think that this attack under Bush's \"command\" represents a\nmeaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that\n\"inescapable web of mutuality\" that Martin Luther King referred to. There\nwas no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative\nconsequences in and for the world.\n\nThe Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to\nthe ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been\nexacerbated by the \"laissez faire\" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that\nClinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship\nthe situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,\nthe world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's\ninternational policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and\ntreaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at\nthe present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address\na deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable\npursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.\nLet's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to\nthose nearest us.\n\nTherefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some\nrestraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at\nthe ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.\nAccusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not\nhelp either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and\nalienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered\nfrom this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe\nharbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate \"captain.\"   Our\ncommitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a\ndeeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will\nthen be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the\nright place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best\ninterests of our nation at heart.\n\nLet us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our\nown, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too\nmuch to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares\ntoo much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human\nbeings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.\n\nSincerely, \n \n \nMichael Rectenwald\nFounder and Chair\nCitizens for Legitimate Government.\n\n \n  _____  \n\n\nTAKE ACTION NOW!

They argue that, \"The DD implicitly overstates the Commission's obligation under these provisions and, consequently, risks the public interest.  While the Commission must assure recovery of the costs incurred by DWR, the statute does not require the Commission to assure full recovery of a fixed value in the face of variable assumptions.  Failing to address these variables could lead to unnecessary rate increases and further injury to the state's economy.  Moreover, while the Commission must adopt a \"stop gap\" allocation of DWR costs among utilities to determine who will make the payments, there is statutory requirement or practical  need for a final, absolute allocation to be adopted before a more careful examination can be made.\"\n \nEPUC concludes by saying that it, \"urges the Commission to tailor narrowly its decision adopting a DWR revenue requirement.  The Commission should adopt a mechanism, as described herein, that would limit or eliminate the difference between DWR actual costs and utility remittances.  The Commission should also adopt only an interim inter-utility allocation, to be reconciled with a final methodology pending a careful and thorough examination of cost responsibility.\"\n \nDan\n \nLaw Offices of Daniel W.

Attached are TURN's comments.  The introduction gives a cogent summary of the consumer group's view of DWR's demands:\n \n\"TURN continues to believe that CDWR has grossly inflated its revenue requirement by billions of dollars through the use of extremely high gas prices and ridiculously high ancillary service costs that are unrelated to current market conditions.  We understand that CDWR has the right under the Water Code to completely ignore consumer interests, recognize that it has done so in this case, and have come to expect that the Department will continue to do so.  CDWR, not the Commission, is the cause of a revenue requirement that is probably bloated by as much as $2 billion of unnecessary costs.\"\n \nTURN also concludes that the Draft Decision places too much of a burden on PG&E and advocates that the \"Commission should also adopt TURN's weighted load method of allocating ancillary services among utilities so that PG&E's extensive self-provision of ancillary services is not siphoned off to benefit other utilities.\"\nIts suggested rates are shown on the following table: \n\n\n\n \n\nDan\n\nLaw Offices of Daniel W.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. \"I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt.\" \nAs part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. \n\"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges,\" Denne said. \nEnron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. \nThe subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. \nEnron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. \nUltimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. \nThursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. \nAfter an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. \nAt 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. \nDunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. \nIn addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.

Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. \nThe contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. \nEnron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. \nThe state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. \nThe Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. \n\"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California,\" said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. \n\n\nEnron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators \nBy Jennifer Coleman\nASSOCIATED PRESS \nSeptember 13, 2001 \nSACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. \nThe Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. \nIn June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. \nThe judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. \nSen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. \nHe said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. \nDunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. \nHe asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. \nEnron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. \nBut Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. \n\"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there,\" he said. \nKirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. \nDunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. \nSen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt \"smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court.\" \nA contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. \nIf the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.","To":["j..kean@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","kristin.walsh@enron.com","david.delainey@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","lamar.frazier@enron.com","kevin.keeney@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","scott.gahn@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","steve.swain@enron.com","john.lavorato@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","don.black@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","louise.kitchen@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","richard.shapiro@enron.com","wanda.curry@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com"],"cont_length":1456,"Week_number":"36","Date":"Fri, 14 Sep 2001 10:21:19 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<4047881.1075851609898.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"California Senate Formally Withdraws Contempt Actions Against Enron"},{"content":"I think Sanders has always thought that the Reliant deal offers sufficient protections.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. \"I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt.\" \nAs part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. \n\"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges,\" Denne said. \nEnron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. \nThe subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. \nEnron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. \nUltimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. \nThursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. \nAfter an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. \nAt 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. \nDunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. \nIn addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents. \n\n\nThe Bee's Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com <mailto:ebazar@sacbee.com>.\n\n\n\n\nEnron and state reach agreement on papers \nThe power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. \nSeptember 14, 2001 \nBy KIMBERLY KINDY\nThe Orange County Register \nSACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. \nThe compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. \nAt stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. \nThe Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. \nWhile delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. \n\"Let's hope cooler minds prevail,\" said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. \nThe contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. \nEnron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. \nThe state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. \nThe Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. \n\"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California,\" said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. \n\n\nEnron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators \nBy Jennifer Coleman\nASSOCIATED PRESS \nSeptember 13, 2001 \nSACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. \nThe Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. \nIn June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. \nThe judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. \nSen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. \nHe said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. \nDunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. \nHe asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. \nEnron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. \nBut Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. \n\"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there,\" he said. \nKirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. \nDunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. \nSen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt \"smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court.\" \nA contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. \nIf the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.","To":["alan.comnes@enron.com"],"cont_length":1598,"Week_number":"36","Date":"Fri, 14 Sep 2001 15:23:29 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<14228279.1075851610118.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: California Senate Formally Withdraws Contempt Actions Against Enron"},{"content":"My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.

(AP) -- \n\nThe state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. \n\nAs the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. \n\nBut senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. \n\n\"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,\" said President Pro Tem John Burton. \"It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation.\" \n\nThe deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. \n\nWithout the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. \n\nThe special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. \n\n\"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,\" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. \"Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.\" \n\nThe new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. \n\nThe shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. \n\nIt also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. \n\nWhile legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. \n\nDavis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. \n\nThe Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. \n\nThe letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. \n\n\"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,\" said Davis. \n\n?2001 Associated Press","To":["david.delainey@enron.com","greg.whalley@enron.com","louise.kitchen@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","john.lavorato@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com"],"cont_length":902,"Week_number":"36","Date":"Sat, 15 Sep 2001 09:52:54 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<18304256.1075852606930.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Unless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning.  \n \nI'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however.

(AP) -- \n\n\nThe state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. \n\n\nAs the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. \n\n\nBut senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. \n\n\n\"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,\" said President Pro Tem John Burton. \"It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation.\" \n\n\nThe deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. \n\n\nWithout the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. \n\n\nThe special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. \n\n\n\"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,\" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. \"Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.\" \n\n\nThe new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. \n\n\nThe shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. \n\n\nIt also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. \n\n\nWhile legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. \n\n\nDavis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. \n\n\nThe Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. \n\n\nThe letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. \n\n\n\"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,\" said Davis. \n\n\n?2001 Associated Press","To":["linda.robertson@enron.com"],"cont_length":1109,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Mon, 17 Sep 2001 10:25:06 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<21322046.1075851610305.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE:"},{"content":"Thanks for the invite, but I have class.

Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or\nsome other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order\ndealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change\nis the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the\nCommission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters\nto continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to\nsupport a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the\ndate to be altered under Commission procedures.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any additional information on this\nsubject.\n\nMike Day\nGoodin, MacBride, Squeri, Ritchie &

However, they can pass a \"waiver,\" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.\n3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.\n\nIn short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.\n\nWhere to from here?\nThrough its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.\nJust before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that \"...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'\" and \"...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end.\"  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  \nGiven the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.\nWith the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.\nFinally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:\nBurton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without \"adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses.\"\nHe doesn't know why \"the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session.\"\nWith all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.\n\nIf all this sounds ridiculous, it is.\n\nWe'll report back with additional information as we get it.\n\nBest,\nJeff","To":["j..kean@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","kristin.walsh@enron.com","david.delainey@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","lamar.frazier@enron.com","kevin.keeney@enron.com","scott.gahn@enron.com","steve.swain@enron.com","john.lavorato@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","don.black@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","louise.kitchen@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","richard.shapiro@enron.com","wanda.curry@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","kelly.higgason@enron.com","greg.whalley@enron.com"],"cont_length":528,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Mon, 17 Sep 2001 13:32:09 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<21636092.1075851610593.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"California Update--09.17.01"},{"content":"Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.

It says, 'Please type your user name and password.'.  This is the exact user name and password \n       you use to logon to your Enron computer.\n\nA Microsoft Outlook Web Access page should open up.  Mine opens directly to my Inbox, yours should too.  If not, one of the shortcuts in \n       the vertical 'tool bar', on the left side of the screen shout be an Inbox icon.  Click on it.      \n\nTo see your folders you will need to click on the word 'Folders' on the left side, vertical 'tool bar'.\n\nPlease try this at work so I can help answer your questions and concerns before you are out and about trying this new system.\n\nNote: When accessing email through the internet you will not have a spell check option.  Your best bet is to copy/paste the email \n                 to a word or excel sheet and spell check it there.  Then make the necessary adjustments in your email before sending.\n\nPlease contact me with any questions you have, or if you need help logging on.\n\nApril","To":["april.hrach@enron.com"],"cont_length":336,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Mon, 17 Sep 2001 16:51:24 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<11776619.1075851610710.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: How to get your Outlook mail remotely"},{"content":"Left him a message earlier.

He has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's best interest to give Gray Davis and the DWR a blank check,\" said Jones.        \n\nAB1X specifies that DWR be entitled to recover the costs of its energy purchases after advising the PUC of the costs.  Most recently, DWR has informed the PUC that their purchases for energy through 2002 will reach $12.6 billion.  If the PUC accepts the draft decision, DWR will now be the state agency making the determination of whether its own purchase costs are \"just and reasonable.\"\n\n            \"Pure and simple it's a rate scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional.  If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the DWR,\" said Jones. \n\n\n\n- MORE -\n\nBJC:27:2\n\n\"As our state weathers this energy challenge and faces great economic uncertainty with a budget deficit looming in the future, never before has it been so important for the PUC to responsibly perform its vital oversight duties, acting in the best interest of Californians,\" said former Governor George Deukmejian, who joined Jones and past PUC Commissioner Stan Hulett today in criticizing the pending PUC action.\n\n            As a former California Attorney General, Deukmejian also expressed strong concerns regarding the legality of the PUC's abdication of authority.\n\n            \"The PUC's power to review rate increases is a power expressly granted to it in our California Constitution.  The Legislature cannot simply delegate this power to another state agency by passing a simple statute.  This transfer of power can only legally occur if a constitutional amendment is passed and AB1X is not a constitutional amendment,\" said Deukmejian.\n\n            Former PUC President and Commissioner Stan Hulett also raised serious questions regarding the shift of constitutional responsibilities from the PUC to the DWR.\n\n\"Even something as seemingly innocuous as relocating the PUC's headquarters from San Francisco to Sacramento would require a constitutional amendment, according to the opinion we received from former Attorney General John Van de Camp when that issues arose some years ago,\" Hulett said.  \"A shift of responsibility of this magnitude would clearly and unambiguously require a constitutional amendment given the enormity of the proposal.\"\n\n            Secretary Jones implored the PUC to suspend action on the draft decision until these extraordinary constitutional questions are addressed.\n\n            \"California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all our sakes, and for the future of our state, we must not allow that to happen,\" said Jones.\n\n- 30 -\n\n \n\nRemarks by Secretary of State Bill Jones Regarding the Unconstitutional Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the Public Utilities Commission \n\nto the Department of Water Resources\n\n \n\n(As Prepared)\n\n \n\nGood morning.  \n\n \n\nThank you for being here today.  . As you know, tomorrow the California Public Utilities Commission will be voting on an extremely important issue that will affect all Californians for years to come.   \n\n \n\nThe PUC will consider abdicating its ratemaking responsibilities to the Department of Water Resources based upon a draft decision by Administrative Law Judge Pulsifer.\n\n \n\nI am here today because I have grave concerns that if the PUC adopts this decision, they will be violating a major provision of California's Constitution.  \n\n \n\nAs California searches for ways to deal with our continuing energy situation it is incumbent upon each of us to examine the ramifications - both short and long term - of every decision we make.  This past weekend the California Legislature chose not to bring legislation affecting the pending bankruptcy of Southern California Edison because many members of the legislature believed that the legislation was severely flawed.\n\n \n\n \n\nLet's examine for a minute why this issue and vote will be taken tomorrow.  This decision rests wholly on the new rate scheme embodied in Assembly Bill 1X (AB1X.).  \n\n \n\nSince January of this year, the DWR has purchased electrical power on behalf of cash and credit poor Southern California Edison (SCE), Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  AB1X granted this authority to DWR. \n\n                        \n\n            AB1X specifies that DWR is entitled to recover the cost of these purchases, and that DWR is to advise the PUC of this amount.  DWR has recently estimated that it will require $12.6 billion to cover the costs of power purchased through 2002.\n\n \n\nAB1X further stipulates that the PUC will approve rates, designed by DWR and paid by the consumers, to cover DWR's expenditures for its energy purchases. Under the law, as laid out in AB1X, DWR and not the PUC will make the determination as to whether its purchase costs of $12.6 billion are \"just and reasonable\" under the law.             \n\n \n\nPure and simple, it is a scheme that the PUC must declare unconstitutional. If the PUC refuses to do so, California risks facing a long period of legal turbulence and uncertainty as a result of the unlawful delegation of powers from the PUC to the Department of Water Resources.  \n\n \n\nThis is a dramatic and extremely troubling break from the current role of the PUC.  For decades, the PUC has aggressively performed the vital task of oversight, through public hearings, to ensure that rates charged California's electrical energy users are \"just and reasonable.\"  Now, that indispensable oversight authority would be delegated to a bureaucratic state agency, the DWR, with no public oversight and no independent decision making authority.\n\n \n\nDo you really trust - or should anyone trust - Governor Davis' setting rates without public oversight?  The Governor's record on energy has been abysmal and he has turned a short-term supply problem into a long-term fiscal crisis.  It would be absolutely wrong and not in the state's interest to give Gray Davis a blank checkbook.\n\n \n\nDWR and Gray Davis would become the sole arbiter of whether the cost of their own energy purchases has been \"just and reasonable.\" Through AB1X, the Legislature has diminished the PUC's role so greatly, that its function is to simply allocate shares of the $12.6 billion revenue requirement to the three utilities.\n\n \n\nThis is a classic case of the fox guarding the hen house - it must not happen.\n\n \n\nThe PUC must not vote to accept this illegal transfer of authority. The PUC must vigorously defend its role.  It must not allow the Legislature to abolish the crucial role it performs: reviewing the reasonableness of the overall purchase costs before they are passed along to ratepayers.\n\n \n\nAs I noted earlier, the reimbursement scheme set forth in AB1X is a violation of California's Constitution. The Legislature's attempt to strip public accountability for the reasonableness of rate increases from the PUC and give it to DWR is appalling.  Nowhere in AB1X is it specified what a reasonableness review conducted by DWR will now be. \n\n \n\nWill senior officials at DWR and Governor Davis gather at a conference table behind locked doors and declare their own power purchases reasonable? \n\n \n\nWill they hold public hearings and subject their expenditures of billions of dollars belonging to the people of California to the scrutiny of the people of California?\n\n \n\n            Looking at their track record, the answer is no.\n\n \n\nThe PUC's power to review rate increases is not merely based on statute.  It is explicitly set out in the California Constitution. This is a very critical distinction. The Legislature cannot transfer or delegate this critical power by a simple statute. It can only be done by constitutional amendment. And AB1X is not a constitutional amendment. \n\n \n\nAccording to California Courts, the PUC \"is not an ordinary administrative agency, but a constitutional body with broad legislative and judicial powers.\" Article XII, section 6, of the California Constitution states the general grant of authority for the PUC to fix rates.  \n\n \n\nSection 6 provides:\n\n \n\n\"The commission may fix rates, establish rules, examine records, issue subpoenas, administer oaths, take testimony, punish for contempt, and prescribe a uniform system of accounts for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction.\"\n\n \n\nThus, \"[t]he Constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities, including the power to fix rates, establish rules, hold various types of hearings, award reparation, and establish its own procedures.\" This is basic California law, reaffirmed time after time by our courts.  \n\n \n\nThese constitutional powers are based firmly on the authority to make factual inquiry into the reasonableness of the rates to be fixed.  In one notable case, PG&E v. Railroad Comm., the federal court reviewed natural gas rates set by the Railroad Commission, predecessor to the PUC.  The court discussed the duties of the ratemaking body to make sure that the rates it fixes be \"reasonable.\" \n\n \n\nBecause the PUC has the authority to \"fix rates,\" it therefore has a corollary duty to make sure that the rates it fixes are reasonable.  \n\n \n\nThis must mean that there is a constitutional duty and right to examine the costs underlying those rates.  AB1X cannot alter or eliminate that duty.  AB1X also cannot strip the core component of any reasonableness review: the close and open-minded examination of those facts being used to justify a rate increase.\n\n \n\nThe Legislature cannot deny the PUC these constitutional powers.  \n\n \n\nBy depriving the PUC the authority to examine underlying costs in the exercise of its duty to \"fix rates,\" the Legislature has improperly sought to modify, curtail and abridge the constitutional powers of the PUC.  To that extent, AB1X is invalid and unconstitutional.\n\n \n\n            In a startling break with California's past history, AB1X allows DWR to retain title to the energy it purchases and then \"resell\" it directly to consumers. The utilities then collect the energy costs from their retail customers and return to DWR the portion of the revenues DWR has said it must have as reimbursement.\n\n \n\n            By any other name, this is a tax. It is an enormous sum of money being paid out by the people of California.\n\n \n\n            According to our courts, the power to set taxes is a legislative function.  DWR is an agency within the executive branch of government. \n\n \n\n            The California Constitution specifies that the powers of one branch shall not be exercised by another branch. \n\n \n\nThe following example highlights the impropriety of the Legislature's delegation of authority to DWR to determine the reasonableness of its own energy purchases.  \n\n \n\n            The Legislature assesses California's highway and transportation needs and then sets the rate for the gasoline tax. Drivers purchasing gas in California pay the tax, on a cents per gallon basis, whenever they buy gas. The Legislature cannot delegate to CalTrans the authority both to determine its own highway construction budget and to set a gasoline tax rate calculated to fund that budget. \n\n \n\nThis situation is identical to DWR. The Legislature has directed DWR to purchase power, as it needs, at prices it is willing to pay. The Legislature has further directed the PUC to authorize rates, without any review to determine their reasonableness, in order to reimburse DWR.\n\n \n\nThe PUC cannot legally - and must not under any circumstances -- abdicate its responsibilities to the people of California.    \n\n \n\nThis is a decision based on the unconstitutional scheme laid out in AB1X, and it's unconscionable for the PUC to vote away its own most precious function: providing accountability for just and reasonable rates for the people of California.\n\n \n\nFor these reasons, I cannot urge in stronger terms that the PUC take the following actions tomorrow on the draft decision:\n\n \n\n1.      Suspend action on the draft decision until the extraordinary constitutional questions are resolved \n\n2.      Seek immediate resolution of these constitutional questions by initiating a lawsuit against the Legislature and the Governor \n\n3.      Adopt regulatory and statutory changes to ensure that public oversight and accountability for just and reasonable rates continues\n\n \n\n            California is poised to take a disastrous leap into unconstitutional government.  For all of our sakes, and the future of our state, this must not be allowed to happen.\n\n \n\n-# # #-","To":["vjw@cleanpower.org"],"cont_length":2314,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Wed, 19 Sep 2001 12:39:30 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<16672880.1075851611906.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Secretary of State Bill Jones Calls Transfer of Rate Fixing Authority From the PUC to DWR Unconstitutional"},{"content":"Thanks a bunch.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMcVicker, Maureen  \nSent:\tWednesday, September 19, 2001 2:19 PM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: Call with Fielder\n\nRick and Jim will call you at 3:30 pm (your time)/  5:30 (Texas time).

Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.","To":["leslie.lawner@enron.com"],"cont_length":869,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 09:14:26 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<8658105.1075851612352.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: FW: OFOs"},{"content":"will do.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPharms, Melinda  \nSent:\tThursday, September 20, 2001 11:00 AM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nCc:\tSteffes, James D.; Thome, Jennifer\nSubject:\tDistribution\n\nHello Jeff.

The official creditors' committee supports the plan.\r\n\"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=\r\nric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=\r\ntioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=\r\nicity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=\r\nthout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,\" said Robert D. Glynn,=\r\n Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=\r\nesident of PG&E Corporation.  \"And, the plan will enable us to provide long=\r\n-term growth prospects to shareholders.\" =20\r\nThe plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =\r\ninto two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=\r\nher. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =\r\nand operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=\r\nm.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=\r\nssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=\r\nart of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=\r\nnd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.\r\nThe electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=\r\nons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=\r\nhe ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=\r\nc Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=\r\nstructures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=\r\natisfy creditor claims.=20\r\nUnder the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=\r\nbination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=\r\nitors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=\r\najority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=\r\neive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=\r\ntive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=\r\nt of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=\r\ned claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=\r\nsh and 40 percent in notes.\r\n =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =\r\nCorporation will be organized as follows:=20\r\n\r\n?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=\r\nion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=\r\nts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=\r\nf the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=\r\n0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=\r\nll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20\r\n\r\n?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=\r\niness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=\r\nc generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=\r\ny under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20\r\n\r\nThe new electric generation business will be a California company establish=\r\ned to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=\r\nssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=\r\ns, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=\r\n00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =\r\nwith all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=\r\neping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=\r\nss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=\r\npany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20\r\nThe new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=\r\nshed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=\r\ntility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=\r\n lines and cables.\r\nThe new gas transmission business will be a California company established =\r\nto own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=\r\ny the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=\r\ns storage facilities. =20\r\nFollowing the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=\r\nll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=\r\nncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=\r\nory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =\r\nfor the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=\r\ne provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=\r\nrisdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =\r\nPower Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=\r\ns transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20\r\nGlynn said, \"This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=\r\nable and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=\r\n company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =\r\ngenerating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=\r\n to pay creditors.\"\r\nThe company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=\r\nf its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=\r\n and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=\r\nially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=\r\nnization.=20\r\n\"We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=\r\n do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,\" said =\r\nGlynn.  \"We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=\r\nhe people who know how to run them best.\"\r\nIn addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=\r\nstomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=\r\nte.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=\r\n for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=\r\nric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=\r\nbility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=\r\nesources.\r\nThe Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =\r\nbe confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20\r\nPaul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=\r\nrs, said \"This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=\r\nesolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.

The official creditors' committee supports the plan.\r\n\"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=\r\nric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=\r\ntioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=\r\nicity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=\r\nthout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,\" said Robert D. Glynn,=\r\n Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=\r\nesident of PG&E Corporation.  \"And, the plan will enable us to provide long=\r\n-term growth prospects to shareholders.\" =20\r\nThe plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =\r\ninto two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=\r\nher. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =\r\nand operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=\r\nm.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=\r\nssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=\r\nart of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=\r\nnd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.\r\nThe electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=\r\nons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=\r\nhe ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=\r\nc Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=\r\nstructures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=\r\natisfy creditor claims.=20\r\nUnder the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=\r\nbination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=\r\nitors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=\r\najority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=\r\neive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=\r\ntive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=\r\nt of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=\r\ned claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=\r\nsh and 40 percent in notes.\r\n =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =\r\nCorporation will be organized as follows:=20\r\n\r\n?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=\r\nion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=\r\nts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=\r\nf the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=\r\n0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=\r\nll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20\r\n\r\n?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=\r\niness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=\r\nc generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=\r\ny under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20\r\n\r\nThe new electric generation business will be a California company establish=\r\ned to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=\r\nssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=\r\ns, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=\r\n00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =\r\nwith all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=\r\neping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=\r\nss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=\r\npany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20\r\nThe new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=\r\nshed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=\r\ntility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=\r\n lines and cables.\r\nThe new gas transmission business will be a California company established =\r\nto own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=\r\ny the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=\r\ns storage facilities. =20\r\nFollowing the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=\r\nll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=\r\nncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=\r\nory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =\r\nfor the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=\r\ne provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=\r\nrisdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =\r\nPower Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=\r\ns transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20\r\nGlynn said, \"This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=\r\nable and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=\r\n company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =\r\ngenerating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=\r\n to pay creditors.\"\r\nThe company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=\r\nf its workforce will be unaffected by the plan.

The official creditors' committee supports the plan.\r\n\"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=\r\nric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=\r\ntioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=\r\nicity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=\r\nthout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,\" said Robert D. Glynn,=\r\n Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=\r\nesident of PG&E Corporation.  \"And, the plan will enable us to provide long=\r\n-term growth prospects to shareholders.\" =20\r\nThe plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =\r\ninto two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=\r\nher. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =\r\nand operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=\r\nm.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=\r\nssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=\r\nart of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=\r\nnd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.\r\nThe electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=\r\nons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=\r\nhe ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=\r\nc Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=\r\nstructures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=\r\natisfy creditor claims.=20\r\nUnder the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=\r\nbination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=\r\nitors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=\r\najority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=\r\neive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=\r\ntive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=\r\nt of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=\r\ned claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=\r\nsh and 40 percent in notes.\r\n =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =\r\nCorporation will be organized as follows:=20\r\n\r\n?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=\r\nion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=\r\nts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=\r\nf the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=\r\n0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=\r\nll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20\r\n\r\n?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=\r\niness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=\r\nc generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=\r\ny under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20\r\n\r\nThe new electric generation business will be a California company establish=\r\ned to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=\r\nssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=\r\ns, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=\r\n00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =\r\nwith all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=\r\neping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=\r\nss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=\r\npany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20\r\nThe new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=\r\nshed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=\r\ntility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=\r\n lines and cables.\r\nThe new gas transmission business will be a California company established =\r\nto own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=\r\ny the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=\r\ns storage facilities. =20\r\nFollowing the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=\r\nll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=\r\nncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=\r\nory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =\r\nfor the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=\r\ne provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=\r\nrisdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =\r\nPower Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=\r\ns transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20\r\nGlynn said, \"This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=\r\nable and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=\r\n company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =\r\ngenerating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=\r\n to pay creditors.\"\r\nThe company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=\r\nf its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=\r\n and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=\r\nially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=\r\nnization.=20\r\n\"We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=\r\n do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,\" said =\r\nGlynn.  \"We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=\r\nhe people who know how to run them best.\"\r\nIn addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=\r\nstomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=\r\nte.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=\r\n for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=\r\nric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=\r\nbility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=\r\nesources.\r\nThe Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =\r\nbe confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20\r\nPaul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=\r\nrs, said \"This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=\r\nesolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=\r\null support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=\r\nr 11 process.\"=20\r\n\"With this plan filed,\" said Glynn, \"we are now focused on bringing the Cha=\r\npter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw=\r\northiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=\r\ns' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders.\"\r\n- 30 -\r\n\r\nAt 10:00 AM Pacific Time today, PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electr=\r\nic Company will discuss the plan of reorganization on a conference call for=\r\n members of the media.

These statements are necessarily subjec=\r\nt to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to dif=\r\nfer materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements.  =\r\nAlthough PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all of th=\r\ne factors that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed, or whether, i=\r\nf confirmed, it will become effective, some of the factors that could affec=\r\nt the outcome materially include: the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi=\r\nngs; the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified; legislative and r=\r\negulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect=\r\nric and natural gas industries in the United States, particularly in Califo=\r\nrnia; whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or =\r\nwhether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all; risks re=\r\nlating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated =\r\nentities, including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial=\r\n projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe=\r\nd claims, and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due =\r\nto, among other reasons, an adverse change in market conditions or in the c=\r\nondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings; =\r\nwhether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to pre-empt relevant n=\r\non-bankruptcy law and if so, whether and the extent to which such assertion=\r\n of jurisdiction is successfully challenged; whether a favorable tax ruling=\r\n or opinion is obtained regarding the tax-free nature of the internal restr=\r\nucturings and  spin off contemplated by the Plan; and the ability of the Ut=\r\nility to successfully disaggregate its businesses;=20\r\n\r\nPlease visit our websites: www.pgecorp.com and www.pge.com","To":["david.parquet@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com"],"cont_length":2088,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 12:27:11 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<1470260.1075851613220.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION"},{"content":"The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.\nThe decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.\nBut astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.

In case you hadn't seen it.  Interestingly, no mention of the transfer of the gas assets.\nBest,\nJeff\nPG&E restructuring bid draws state ire \nBy Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton\nBee Staff Writers \n(Published Sept. 21, 2001)\n\nIn a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. \nTo make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. \nPG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state \"bailout.\" Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. \nThe plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. \nBut it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nFERC \"has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer,\" Davis told reporters Thursday. \"The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment.\" \nThe PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. \"I don't think the judge is going to do it,\" said PUC President Loretta Lynch. \nConsumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. \"It's complete piracy,\" said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. \"It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen.\" \nFiled six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. \nThat would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. \nPG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. \n\"Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws,\" said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. \nRobert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- \"the lower end\" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. \nBut that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. \nAnd Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. \n\"This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with,\" Cohen said. \nDespite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. \nThe plan also requires approval from federal officials and a \"yes\" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. \nGlynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. \nWhile the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. \"From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless,\" he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. \nThe PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't \"asking the state for a bailout or a rescue\" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. \nIt's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. \nThe PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. \nThe utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. \nThe bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. \nDespite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had \"in-depth discussions\" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. \nAlso, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. \nIf state officials fight the plan, \"the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' \" Bodek said. \"Here's a plan that does that.\" \nThe plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. \n\"There's some credibility here, and it works,\" Aronzon said of the plan. \nGary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. \nShareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall","To":["barry.tycholiz@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","david.parquet@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","leslie.lawner@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","michael.etringer@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com"],"cont_length":1351,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Fri, 21 Sep 2001 10:06:15 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<7091893.1075851613766.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Reaction to PG&E's Proposed Reorganization"},{"content":"you mean to hold it?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Cherry, Brian [mailto:BKC7@pge.com]\nSent: Friday, September 21, 2001 11:00 AM\nTo: Dasovich Jeff (E-mail)\nSubject: Brown's Move\n\n\nWell, it looks like Loretta isn't as smart as she thinks she is....","To":["'cherry@enron.com","bkc7@pge.com"],"cont_length":45,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Fri, 21 Sep 2001 10:07:02 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<8103242.1075851613789.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Brown's Move"},{"content":"Apologies for missing the call yesterday.

Thank you so much for taking the time to\nhear about our latest developments.  As I said earlier, we are very\ninterested in talking to your folks in the Net Works group at Enron.  The\npilot we are implementing for the Enron Energy Services group is going\nextremely well.  We've been on site now for about two weeks and have pretty\nmuch completed our user training sessions.  Everyone at Enron is very\npleased with the success of the project so far.  \n\nI think the best thing would be to schedule a meeting for sometime in\nmid-October.  That way, the Pilot Program will be completely implemented and\nwe will have more feedback on the use of our application.  How about the\nweek of October 15th?  Anytime that week will work with us and, as I told\nyou earlier, we are in Houston very frequently.\n\nThe people who would be a part of the discussion would be Ian Sullivan (who\nheads up all implementation and professional services) and myself.\n\nIf anyone would like more information about Perfect Commerce prior to the\nmeeting I would be more than happy to send that over.  Just let me know.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nCameron \n\n\nCameron Sellers\nVice President, Business Development\nPERFECT\n1860 Embarcadero Road - Suite 210\nPalo Alto, CA 94303\ncameron@perfect.com\n650.798.3366 (direct dial)\n650.269.3366 (cell)\n650.858.1095 (fax)","To":["cameron@perfect.com"],"cont_length":301,"Week_number":"37","Date":"Fri, 21 Sep 2001 16:57:59 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<1031864.1075851614809.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: meeting with Enron"},{"content":"Overall looks great, though I made a few edits/comments.

The s=\r\ntate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=\r\nven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=\r\nad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20\r\n\r\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =\r\nMonday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=\r\n California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =\r\nof line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=\r\n FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20\r\n\r\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=\r\ns - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=\r\n since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=\r\ne meeting.=20\r\n\r\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=\r\nres of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=\r\nhs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=\r\nructure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of the meeting is to dev=\r\nelop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=\r\n and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=\r\nocedures.\"=20\r\n\r\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20\r\n\r\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=\r\n on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=\r\nich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=\r\n.=20\r\n\r\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=\r\ndit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =\r\nthe market, Wolfman's office said.=20\r\n\r\n\"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=\r\nit of CAISO,\" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =\r\ndivision states. \"This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =\r\nlead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=\r\n other practices by the ISO should be investigated.\"=20\r\n\r\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=\r\nwer first.=20\r\n\r\n\"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=\r\n the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=\r\nr at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,\" the =\r\nsecond letter says.=20\r\n\r\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=\r\nined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=\r\neting.=20\r\n\r\nGenerators Confused=20\r\n\r\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

The s=\r\ntate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=\r\nven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=\r\nad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20\r\n\r\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =\r\nMonday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=\r\n California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =\r\nof line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=\r\n FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20\r\n\r\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=\r\ns - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=\r\n since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=\r\ne meeting.=20\r\n\r\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=\r\nres of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=\r\nhs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=\r\nructure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of the meeting is to dev=\r\nelop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=\r\n and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=\r\nocedures.\"=20\r\n\r\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20\r\n\r\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=\r\n on the state's electrical grid.

And he thinks he may have\nstumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the\ncritical months of the California energy crisis.\nWhat Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case (RP00-241), the California Public Utilities\nCommission, may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during\nthe months of the controversial large-volume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co. and\naffiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co.\nLangdon, a partner in the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, in late July was\nhired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the\nrecord in the case (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The idea was \"not to second-guess the lawyers litigating the case,\" but\nrather to \"think dispassionately about the events of last year\" and give Wise \"an independent view\" of the\nbehavior of the El Paso companies before and during the 15-month contract for 1.22 Bcf/day of capacity to\nCalifornia, Langdon explained last week.\nWise's decision to hire Langdon was eye-catching on a few levels. In his many years in law practice,\nLangdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for, Langdon told\nInside FERC, acknowledging \"this really was a little bit of an unusual request.\"\nAlso drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdon's substantial administration connec-tions.\nHe was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon, who as\na FERC commissioner in the early 1990s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser.\nIs it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition\nand the possibility that he may have some positive, collateral impact on the commission's ultimate\ndecision in this case?\nThat possibility \"didn't escape me\" at the time, Langdon admitted. \"I'll not pretend to be unaware\nthat there are these other connections with Wood and the president,\" he allowed, adding that \"that's\nsomething that impacts everything I do. But what can I do? I have to practice law.\" And, \"for the\nrecord, I barely know Pat Wood.\"\nAnd how can this be considered an independent, third-party assessment if El Paso is paying for\nLangdon's services? \"I recognize that there are critics and cynics\" who would suggest that Langdon is\nsimply a hired gun, \"but at the end of the day, . . . I'll have to stand behind\" the report. He vowed to\n\"call it the way I see it.\"\nHis final report to Wise won't be ready for several weeks, but Langdon shared some of his initial\nthoughts and findings.\nLangdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern\nCalifornia Gas Co. storage facilities - the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County\nand the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County. During the period that roughly coincides with the El\nPaso/El Paso Merchant contract, SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large\nvolumes of storage gas from those fields, said Langdon. The state commission finally granted the requests\nin June 2001, the month after termination of the contract, he related.\nRelease of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso\nCanyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100,000\nDt/day of deliverability to the California gas market \"without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity,\"\nsaid Langdon. Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network, he stressed that\n\"storage is huge\" in moderating the market. When pipeline capacity is constrained, \"storage is a way to\ntake care of . . . these problems.\"\nAnd yet, the SoCal Gas applications \"clearly languished\" at the CPUC. \"There may be very good reasons\"\nwhy the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas, but so far \"I don't understand how the CPUC\nsits on a storage application like that during this time period when it's as significant as it is.\"\nFor its part, the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state\nborder to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its\nfeet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project (IF, 14 May, 5). \"I'm trying not to sound like an\nadvocate in this thing,\" said Langdon, but \"I don't understand the CPUC's position in the case, . . . when\nright in their own back yard they've got these storage issues.\"\nAs for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the\ncontract and subsequently \"withheld massive amounts of capacity\" from the market, \"we've reached the\nconclusion that we don't see that kind of evidence in what's been presented\" so far in the proceeding, said\nLangdon. His team of lawyers is looking closely at \"the maze of engineering issues\" that could hold the\nanswer to the capacity withholding issue.\nLangdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations\ncolliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving\nenergy market. Order 497, the marketing-affiliate rule, was first promulgated in 1986, he noted.\nIn most industries, such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace. But here, the\ngas industry has \"been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of, and yet these rules are the\nvery same ones\" that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years. \"They absolutely need to\nbe updated, end of sentence, end of paragraph,\" said Langdon.\nDespite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. about\nthe strength of the El Paso case, Langdon said he was \"not at all concerned about the company not\ngetting a fair shake\" at the commission. Much of what Wagner had to say \"has been sensationalized to\na degree\" in the press, he said, adding that \"what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are\ntwo different things.\"\nLangdon admitted that he would be \"a little concerned\" about Wagner's remarks \"if I were litigating\nthe case.\" The judge has used some \"pretty strong language\" to suggest that the El Paso companies were\nout of line. But FERC \"historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal,\" and \"in this case, the record\nlooks very sound,\" he said. - Chris Newkumet","To":["w..cantrell@enron.com"],"cont_length":1257,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Mon, 24 Sep 2001 09:07:51 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<24895167.1075851615551.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE:"},{"content":"you got it.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tShapiro, Richard  \nSent:\tMonday, September 24, 2001 11:27 AM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: Intention to Challenge the California's PUC's Decision to Suspend DA\n\nLet's hold off scheduling for the moment.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDasovich, Jeff  \nSent:\tMonday, September 24, 2001 10:37 AM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard\nSubject:\tRE: Intention to Challenge the California's PUC's Decision to Suspend DA\n\nWill do.

How many times must Californians pay? \tWe worked with consumer and business \tgroups to oppose the bill.\n2)\tIn the \"alternative MOU\" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct \tAccess until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison.\n3)\tRod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and \tbilling services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained \tunswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.\n\nHope this helps.

Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:\n\nOne could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.\n\nWe are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. \n\nSomething else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. \n\n\tDWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance?

Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:\n\nOne could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.\n\nWe are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. \n\nSomething else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. \n\n\tDWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  \n\n\tWe think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. \n\nFor these reasons we must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n/s/ HENRY M.

In the meantime, PG&E's filed rate case\n> continues in court, with every likelihood of success, further limiting the\n> damage that the demented regulators can impose.\n> PG&E's hydro system is already subject to Federal Energy Regulatory\n> Commission regulation, although many consumer groups in the state don't\n> seem to understand that fact. Under the reorganization plan, the Diablo\n> Canyon nuclear plant would become a wholesale provider with a\n> FERC-approved tariff. PG&E's pipeline system, historically a \"Hinshaw\"\n> pipeline not subject to federal jurisdiction, would become a traditional\n> interstate system under FERC jurisdiction.\n> The politicians and regulators quickly recognized what PG&E would do and\n> have been gnashing their teeth furiously since the announcement. But it\n> appears there is little they can do other than lament. The plan would not\n> raise rates, so the court has no reason to consult with the CPUC. And\n> federal law clearly trumps state law when it comes to protecting\n> creditors. \n> The fact that the creditors are lined up behind the reorganization plan is\n> the worst news the state could hear. According to bankruptcy experts, it\n> is highly unlikely that the court would reject a plan that the creditors\n> endorse. Because they get all their money paid, with interest, the\n> creditors are largely made whole (the largest will have to take some notes\n> as part of the repayment).\n> Will the bankruptcy reorganization plan lead Southern California Edison\n> into bankruptcy? There are two lines of argument on this question, both\n> valid. One suggests that the plan will lead Gov. Gray Davis and the\n> backers of his Edison bailout to push harder for quick action, lest Edison\n> decide it can do better in court than it can in the Legislature. The other\n> line argues that PG&E's plan will lead Edison's creditors to put the\n> utility quickly into Chapter 11 involuntarily.\n> The Reuters news service last week reported that power generators Mirant\n> Corp. and Reliant Energy are looking for a third creditor to push the\n> company into involuntary bankruptcy. Sources indicate that the city of\n> Long Beach may be the third creditor needed to push the state's second\n> largest utility into bankruptcy\n> Ted Craver, chief financial officer of Edison International, the utility's\n> parent, told a conference call to creditors last week that the company\n> would not voluntarily seek bankruptcy protection and would \"vigorously\n> oppose any involuntary bankruptcy petition.\" But under bankruptcy law,\n> according to legal experts, once the creditors file, there is little\n> Edison could do. \n> In addition, the unveiling of the PG&E plan last Thursday will embolden\n> Republicans in the Legislature, and perhaps some Democrats, to put a\n> rescue package for SCE on hold.

The s=\r\ntate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=\r\nven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=\r\nad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20\r\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =\r\nMonday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=\r\n California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =\r\nof line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=\r\n FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20\r\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=\r\ns - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=\r\n since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=\r\ne meeting.=20\r\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=\r\nres of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=\r\nhs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=\r\nructure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of the meeting is to dev=\r\nelop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=\r\n and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=\r\nocedures.\"=20\r\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20\r\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=\r\n on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=\r\nich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=\r\n.=20\r\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=\r\ndit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =\r\nthe market, Wolfman's office said.=20\r\n\"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=\r\nit of CAISO,\" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =\r\ndivision states. \"This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =\r\nlead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=\r\n other practices by the ISO should be investigated.\"=20\r\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=\r\nwer first.=20\r\n\"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=\r\n the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=\r\nr at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,\" the =\r\nsecond letter says.=20\r\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=\r\nined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=\r\neting.=20\r\nGenerators Confused=20\r\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp. (MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investme=\r\nnts/quotes/?symbol=3DMIR>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news=\r\n/?symbol=3DMIR>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbo=\r\nl=3DMIR>), Reliant Energy Inc.

That's because, according to the allegations, the I=\r\nSO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as \"out-of-market\"=\r\n purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=\r\narticipants see.=20\r\nDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=\r\nR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=\r\n in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=\r\nterm contracts.=20\r\nThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=\r\nhe ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=\r\nrs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=\r\nized market.

The s=\r\ntate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=\r\nven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=\r\nad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20\r\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =\r\nMonday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=\r\n California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =\r\nof line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=\r\n FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20\r\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=\r\ns - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=\r\n since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=\r\ne meeting.=20\r\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=\r\nres of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=\r\nhs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=\r\nructure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of the meeting is to dev=\r\nelop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=\r\n and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=\r\nocedures.\"=20\r\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20\r\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=\r\n on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=\r\nich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=\r\n.=20\r\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=\r\ndit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =\r\nthe market, Wolfman's office said.=20\r\n\"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=\r\nit of CAISO,\" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =\r\ndivision states. \"This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =\r\nlead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=\r\n other practices by the ISO should be investigated.\"=20\r\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=\r\nwer first.=20\r\n\"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=\r\n the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=\r\nr at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,\" the =\r\nsecond letter says.=20\r\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=\r\nined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=\r\neting.=20\r\nGenerators Confused=20\r\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

That's because, according to the allegations, the I=\r\nSO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as \"out-of-market\"=\r\n purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=\r\narticipants see.=20\r\nDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=\r\nR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=\r\n in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=\r\nterm contracts.=20\r\nThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=\r\nhe ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=\r\nrs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=\r\nized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=\r\ne out-of-market prices for months.=20\r\nNone of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=\r\nlif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=\r\n expected to attend.

In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. \nBut a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. \nBesides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. \nTuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. \n\"It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11,\" said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. \nAs senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. \n\"There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations,\" Taylor said. \nThe level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. \nThe notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. \nHad the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance \"would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated.\" \nEven so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to \"move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year.\"","To":["j..kean@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com"],"cont_length":812,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Wed, 26 Sep 2001 08:30:10 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<17902629.1075851616890.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Angelides Now Says that Bonds Can't Be Issued Before 2002"},{"content":"Sue has informed me that since she has most recently drawn the short straw, I'm next in line for meetings with Brown.

Importantly, the merger settlement provided $32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania.\n\nThis year, the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit, Power Team, presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania. These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement, and are not included in the $32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding.\n\nNow a key force in renewable energy development in the East, the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms, two of which will be operational next month. The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week, and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week.\n\nMike Freeman, the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible, gave us some insight into Exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into America's power grids.\n---------------------------------\nWhat's in Power Team's renewable portfolio?\nWe have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage, 150 MW of wind, 100 MW of landfill methane, 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste, 20 MW of wood waste, and 16 MW of scrap tires.\n\nAll of the wind is Green-e certifiable as \"new\" resources. All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e, but only 10 MW is new generation. Of the hydro, all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards. The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e, but the biomass plant is. \n\nWhy is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio?\nThere were two principal reasons: a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace, and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel, emissions, and cost.\n\nWas there internal resistance or other issues to overcome?\nI think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business. I don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases. Part of the hands-off approach was due to, I believe, a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation, not changing the power system in any way. \n\nOver time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system. For me that's the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development. I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable, and that demand for these products could be sustaining. \n\nWill this encourage new development? \nGenerators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location, but is also willing to talk about additional new projects. Over time, other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same. If this chain of events occurs, I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter, just like other energy products now. \n\nHow do renewables fit into Power Team's overall business strategy?\nWe are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio. So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy. More specifically, we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy, not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards, but also because of natural demand. The average person may not think of it this way, but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements.  \n\nWhy Wind?\nThere's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements, under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects. A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998, and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year. A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years, and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand, including supply-side and demand-side solutions. We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources. \n\nWhat are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal?\nThe first is probably the need for a long-term contract. Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price, long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period. We don't have a problem with long-term deals per se, although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well. We don't want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else. \n\nIn my discussions with generators so far, there has been some flexibility on contract length. In fact, our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built. Beyond the long-term contract, the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating. Exelon Generation is rated A- by S&P so we are a natural counter-party for project financing. Right now, there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have. \n\nWill that always will be the case? \nNo. If we're right about long-lasting demand, I think other large companies, including distribution companies, will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects. We've teamed up with a retail marketer, Community Energy, to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it. In the development of conventional generation, it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built. For example, a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods. And in some cases, the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing. \n\nIs there a financial advantage for wind?  \nIf one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value, a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have. Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility. This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present. \n\nIt is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term. But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project, outside of significant advances in technology. Over a long period of time, 15 or 20 years, I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite.\n\nI do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years. \n\nIs it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio?\nWith conventional generation and firm transmission paths, a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets, whether they are hourly, daily, monthly, or longer. Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing, amount and ultimate sink of expected output. \n\nThe contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100% of the time as possible, so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy. The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different, because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy. \n\nI think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio. We're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix.\n\nHow does intermittent generation add complexity?\nA wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows, not when you flip the switch on. It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency, even for an experienced organization like ours, because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind. You don't have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand. \n\nIn PJM, where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis, and receive (or pay) market-clearing prices depending on actual generation, wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties. An obstacle, and we're working with PJM on this right now, is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity. For purposes of regulating the system, PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate, or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand. \n\nThis will not be practical with wind generation. We'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do. In the must-run scenario, we'd still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators. Either way, we'd have to predict output, which is a dicey \nproposition. \n\nDoes that make wind generation unreliable?\nNot at all. We've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time, such as a full year. Those predictions underlie our contracts. But it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow. The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what I've described. In PJM, a 54,000 MW system, this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now, but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives. A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system. \n\nThe complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution. \n\nHow can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind?\nAn alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as \"negative\" load instead of generation. Which is to say, when the plant is generating electricity, the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating. When the plant is not generating, the load will increase. A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve. In this unique circumstance, which of the ancillary services apply to negative load, and at what level? We're working with PJM on these questions. \n\nI'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider. Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load, and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way. Other countries, and the western U.S. transmission systems, have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation, and so can we. \n\nAre you working on other approaches?\nAnother possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market, to a control area that does have such a market. The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis.  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment. However, notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach.\n\nWill PJM resolve these problems?\nYes. PJM is progressive and innovative, and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling/imbalance issue. It's hard now because we're breaking new ground. I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed. \n\nHow big might your renewable portfolio get? Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects? \nAs long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy, we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy. I'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market, such as PJM, to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output.\n\nWe need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed. We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on. If we execute a contract successfully, we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company. Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. and National Wind Power. \n\nWhat are some key developments to make the industry grow faster?\nWe need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment, standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation, financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing, and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, we need consumers to buy the wind energy! \n\n---------------------------------\nE-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications.

The s=\r\ntate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=\r\nven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=\r\nad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20\r\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =\r\nMonday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=\r\n California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =\r\nof line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=\r\n FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20\r\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=\r\ns - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=\r\n since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=\r\ne meeting.=20\r\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=\r\nres of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=\r\nhs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=\r\nructure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of the meeting is to dev=\r\nelop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=\r\n and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=\r\nocedures.\"=20\r\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20\r\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=\r\n on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=\r\nich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=\r\n.=20\r\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=\r\ndit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =\r\nthe market, Wolfman's office said.=20\r\n\"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=\r\nit of CAISO,\" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =\r\ndivision states. \"This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =\r\nlead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=\r\n other practices by the ISO should be investigated.\"=20\r\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=\r\nwer first.=20\r\n\"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=\r\n the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=\r\nr at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,\" the =\r\nsecond letter says.=20\r\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=\r\nined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=\r\neting.=20\r\nGenerators Confused=20\r\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

That's because, according to the allegations, the I=\r\nSO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as \"out-of-market\"=\r\n purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=\r\narticipants see.=20\r\nDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=\r\nR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=\r\n in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=\r\nterm contracts.=20\r\nThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=\r\nhe ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=\r\nrs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=\r\nized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=\r\ne out-of-market prices for months.=20\r\nNone of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=\r\nlif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=\r\n expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=\r\ning isn't open to the public.=20\r\nThe meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =\r\noperational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=\r\nve the market.=20\r\n\"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =\r\nby all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=\r\nctices,\" Wolfman said in the letter.=20\r\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjone=\r\ns.com <mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com>=20\r\n   << File: 092101PCG.pdf >> =20\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate an=\r\nd may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the =\r\nintended recipient (s).

The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.\n \nThe primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: \n\n\nThe Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.\n\nThe failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).\n\n The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.\n\n The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.\n\n The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  \n\n The Decision's purported findings are not supported.\n\nThe Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.\n\nAlthough WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.\n \nI look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtood weekend!\n \nDan\n \nLaw Offices of Daniel W.

Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.\n\nFurther summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:\n\nAlan Comnes\n\n\nThe Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).\n\nRTOs \n\nChairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.\n\nOrganizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to \"marry up,\" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.\n\nStructural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an \"RTO week\" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.\n\nWood also recognized that some \"sticks\" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these \"sticks\" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.\n\nWith regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how \"FERC can get there.\"  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.\n\nWhile Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.\n\nUpcoming Dates\n\n\tOctober 15-19 --\tRTO Workshops\n\tEnd of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs\n\tDecember 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked\n\n\nProposed Rule for Standards of Conduct\n\nWithin the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NOPR\") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.\n\nThe NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  \n\nThere was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.\n\nProvision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)\n\nChairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  \n\nAfter the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  \n\nCommissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  \n\nRealizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.\n\nSorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.\n\nSarah","To":["alan.comnes@enron.com"],"cont_length":1365,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Wed, 26 Sep 2001 14:43:43 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<9503306.1075851617540.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: FERC Meeting Summary"},{"content":"Could you check and see if the Roundtable would like to sign on?

The s=\r\ntate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=\r\nven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=\r\nad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20\r\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =\r\nMonday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=\r\n California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =\r\nof line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=\r\n FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20\r\nThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=\r\ns - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=\r\n since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=\r\ne meeting.=20\r\n\"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=\r\nres of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=\r\nhs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=\r\nructure,\" Wolfman said in her letter. \"The purpose of the meeting is to dev=\r\nelop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=\r\n and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=\r\nocedures.\"=20\r\nISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20\r\nThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=\r\n on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=\r\nich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=\r\n.=20\r\nIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=\r\ndit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =\r\nthe market, Wolfman's office said.=20\r\n\"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=\r\nit of CAISO,\" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =\r\ndivision states. \"This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =\r\nlead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=\r\n other practices by the ISO should be investigated.\"=20\r\nThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=\r\nwer first.=20\r\n\"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=\r\n the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=\r\nr at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,\" the =\r\nsecond letter says.=20\r\nThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=\r\nined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=\r\neting.=20\r\nGenerators Confused=20\r\nGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

That's because, according to the allegations, the I=\r\nSO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as \"out-of-market\"=\r\n purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=\r\narticipants see.=20\r\nDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=\r\nR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=\r\n in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=\r\nterm contracts.=20\r\nThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=\r\nhe ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=\r\nrs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=\r\nized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=\r\ne out-of-market prices for months.=20\r\nNone of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=\r\nlif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=\r\n expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=\r\ning isn't open to the public.=20\r\nThe meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =\r\noperational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=\r\nve the market.=20\r\n\"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =\r\nby all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=\r\nctices,\" Wolfman said in the letter.=20\r\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjone=\r\ns.com <mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com>=20\r\n   << File: 092101PCG.pdf >> =20\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate an=\r\nd may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the =\r\nintended recipient (s).

Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  \n\nWord on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC \"study\" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by \"green Senators\" to pass a \"green only\" DA bill.\n\nIn addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.\n\nThe idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  \n\nWe'll report back with news as we get it.\n\nBest,\nJeff \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Scott Govenar [mailto:sgovenar@govadv.com]\nSent: Wednesday, September 26, 2001 12:24 PM\nTo: Rick Shapiro; Steffes, James D.; Kaufman, Paul; Jeff Dasovich;\nKingerski, Harry; Lawner, Leslie; Susan J Mara; Hedy Govenar; Bev\nHansen; Mike Day\nSubject: MOU Update\n\n\nI spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy.

Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. \nThe poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. \nRiordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo. \n\"It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor,\" he said. \"It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis.\" \nIn a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. \nThe poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. \nDavis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was \"horribly misleading.\" \n\"These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval,\" he said. \"These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general.\" \nDiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. \nIn May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. \nVoters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent. \n\"Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed,\" DiCamillo said. \"He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. \n\"No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative.\" \nDiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. \nRiordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis. \n\"It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most,\" he said. \"Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way.\" \nSouth said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. \n\"We all know how that turned out,\" he said. \"A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942.\" \nThe Bee's Amy Chance can be reached at (916) 326-5535 or achance@sacbee.com <mailto:achance@sacbee.com>.","To":["j..kean@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","pat.shortridge@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>"],"cont_length":710,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Wed, 26 Sep 2001 15:35:37 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<19628515.1075851617763.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis."},{"content":"Thanks very much.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: \"the palace coup.\"\n\nLawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.\n\nThe central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.\n\nWinter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.\n\n\"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,\" said Dunn.\n\nThe subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.\n\nDavis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt \"betrayed\" by the actions of Winter.\n\n\"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,\" Maviglio said.\n\nWinter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. \n\n\"It was an emergency,\" Fishman said.\n\n\"We had to take action.'' \n\nWhat became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. \n\n\"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,\" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.\n\n\"All hell broke loose.''\n\nRecords show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.\n\n\"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.\n\nAlthough there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to \"fix\" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.\n\nIn the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.\n\nThe generators got their way.\n\nThe next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.\n\nPower producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. \n\nThey began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. \n\nWhat followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.\n\nWinter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. \n\nNeither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it.\n\n\"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. \n\nWith the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.\n\n\"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. \"It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business.\" \n\nPrices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.\n\nDunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.\n\nRobinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.\n\nRobinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.\n\n\"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. \"In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund.\" \n\nJan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.\n\n\"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.\n\n\"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing.\"\n\nThe ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.\n\nJames J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.\n\n\"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. \n\n\"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do.\"\n\nWhat Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.\n\n\"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,\" Dunn said. \"Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''","To":["susan.mara@enron.com"],"cont_length":1348,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Thu, 27 Sep 2001 08:53:19 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<21700453.1075851617971.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Probing the 'palace coup' --   or \"eating their own\""},{"content":"Haven't heard anything about it, though Sue's been closer to these issues.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSmith, Mike  \nSent:\tThursday, September 27, 2001 10:58 AM\nTo:\tmday@gmssr.com; Dasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan\nSubject:\tOverpaid CA UUT Refund Notice\n\nDo you know anything about this?

Understanding that \"new\" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  \n\nThe 3 choices I see are:\n\n1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.\n2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.\n3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.\n\nIt seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.\n\nThe commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.

Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation\nissues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities\nwill insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go\nscreaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any\nportion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20.  As indicated in\nprevious calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept\n20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be\nextended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct\naccess without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension\nIF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20.  At this\ntime we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although\nas Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which\nwill likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the\ncommission on these issues.  Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural\nschedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues.\n\nBottom line:  The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by\nmeans of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after\nSept. 20.  Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the\nexisting agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal\nor extension issue is addressed by the Commission.  Post Sept. 20 amendments\nto the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the\npre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. \n\nMike Day\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff [mailto:Jeff.Dasovich@ENRON.com]\nSent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 10:06 AM\nTo: Smith, Mike; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.; mday@gmssr.com;\nWilliams, Robert C.\nCc: Sharp, Vicki; Higgason, Kelly; Maynard, Michelle\nSubject: RE: Extensions of CA Deals\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I concur with Mike.

Marois \nSacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. \nThe governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. \nSouthern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. \nThe Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. \nThe latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.","To":["jeff.dasovich@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","kristin.walsh@enron.com","david.delainey@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","lamar.frazier@enron.com","kevin.keeney@enron.com","scott.gahn@enron.com","steve.swain@enron.com","john.lavorato@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","don.black@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","louise.kitchen@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","richard.shapiro@enron.com","wanda.curry@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","kelly.higgason@enron.com","greg.whalley@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com"],"cont_length":226,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Thu, 27 Sep 2001 15:36:57 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<30537130.1075851618764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis"},{"content":"Maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the Hyatt to the Burbank airport Monday morning.

In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. \nElection of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: \nThe election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. \nIdentification of Special Session Bills and Publications: \nSeparate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. \nIntroduction of Special Session Bills: \nThere is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. \nSpecial Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: \nThere is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the \"30-day in print\" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. \nEffective Date of Special Session Legislation: \nSimple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. \nEnd of Special Session: \nOnly the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session.

Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.\n\nThe letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.\n\nThe letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers.\n\n\"This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such,\" says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has\" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, \"but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question.\n\n\"Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement,\" Bates wrote.\n\nThe five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.\n\nEdison officials refused to comment.\n\nThe frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.\n\nEdison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion.\n\n\"Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally,\" said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.\n\nA spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. \"It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us,\" Patrick Dorinson said.\n\nSo far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.\n\nDavis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.\n\nOther Creditors Take Notice\n\nSenate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.\n\nThe letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue.\n\n\"From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over,\" said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.\n\nMoorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court.\n\n\"By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first,\" Moorlach said.\n\nBut Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE.\n\n\"We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy,\" Lawrence said.\n\nEdison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.\n\nBy January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.\n\nEdison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.\n\nThe generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.\n\nShares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n*\n\nTimes staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this report.","To":["j..kean@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","b..sanders@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>"],"cont_length":1090,"Week_number":"38","Date":"Sat, 29 Sep 2001 09:36:45 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<14912503.1075852597283.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"LA Times: Firms Push Edison Near Bankruptcy"},{"content":"Thanks and see you soon.

Immediate renegotiation is urged.\nBy VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL\nTimes Staff Writers\n\nSeptember 30 2001\n\nSACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. \n\nThe biggest problems are so-called \"take or pay\" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. \n\nThe contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. \n\nBetween January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. \n\nPower generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. \n\n\"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it,\" said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has \"no intention of asking for renegotiation\" on its own. \n\nJan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, \"I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction.\" \n\nAnd he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. \"We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations,\" he said. \n\nFor his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. \n\n\"Would we love to get a better deal?\" Maviglio said. \"Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table.\" \n\nS. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. \n\n\"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit,\" said Freeman, \"but it's a good thing to have.\" \n\nBut William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. \n\nThe study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. \n\nThe study singled out for criticism: \n\n* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. \n\nThe contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. \n\n* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be \"peakers,\" designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. \n\n\"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million,\" said Marcus. \"That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much.\" \n\n* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. \n\n* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n\n* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. \n\n* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. \n\nOne of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. \n\nBut a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. \n\n\"When you compare those two contracts,\" Marcus said, \"you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate.\" \n\n* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. \n\n* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\nMarcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. \n\nThose large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. \n\n\"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty,\" said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. \"To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas.\" \n\nWhen the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. \n\nMarcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. \n\nAnother weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. \n\nWindmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. \n\n\"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy,\" Marcus said. \n\n\"I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin.\"","To":["j..kean@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","linda.robertson@enron.com","m..landwehr@enron.com","janel.guerrero@enron.com","sue.nord@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com"],"cont_length":1611,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Sun, 30 Sep 2001 08:25:37 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<21097453.1075851619454.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"LA Times Story on Bad DWR Long-term Contracts"},{"content":"FYI.\n\n8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals\nEnergy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds.

Gray Davis. \nThe state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. \n\"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,\" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. \"I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.\" \nThe PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n\"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. \nHidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. \n\"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,\" Hidalgo said. \"If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.\" \nThe state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. \nHidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. \nOver the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. \nSEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS\nTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. \nThe deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. \nGallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. \nDavis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. \nThe PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. \nThe commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. \nSTATE TREASURER'S WARNING\nState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. \nPUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. \n\"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,\" Lynch said last week. \"We should stay as flexible as possible. \nLynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. \nCommissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. \n\"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,\" he said. \"Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.\" \nHidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. \nJan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. \n\"Now another California agency is disputing it,\" Mitchell said. \"We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.\" \nPUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS\nThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. \n\"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,\" the PUC said. \nAn energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. \nUncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. \nWhile officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. \n***************************************************","To":["j..kean@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","m..landwehr@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>"],"cont_length":1056,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 08:30:16 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<6497591.1075851619575.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"It seems to be unraveling for Davis--Need Ron or Dan to get CPUC Filings at FERC"},{"content":"Alice, whom I used to ride with and her guy Jeff (remember we went to their place in Petaluma some time back--chicken coups?) is getting married on Sunday, October 21 at 3 o'clock on Mare Island.

I just wanted=\r\n to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue t=\r\nhings further with Norm.  After drilling down even further, it just seemed =\r\nlike we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based =\r\nupon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the n=\r\nature of Norm's historical client base.  It also would not have been fair t=\r\no Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he=\r\n had planned to pursue at the Firm.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate=\r\n your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the sit=\r\nuation.  I really felt bad bothering you with this, but I knew you would ha=\r\nve the best insights into the likely direction of the regulatory proceeding=\r\ns in CA and I wanted to make sure that I was being fair in evaluating Norm'=\r\ns situation and in a position to make a decision based on all of the releva=\r\nnt facts.  I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use =\r\nthose words together!) that I do not want you to think or feel that you \"ni=\r\nxed\" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.=\r\n  In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a s=\r\nense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has b=\r\neen pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-start=\r\ner since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other sid=\r\ne from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.  It is on=\r\ne thing to receive a waiver to represent another company in a negotiated co=\r\nmmercial transaction in which Enron is relying on another law firm, but I c=\r\nould not see us pressing a regulatory agenda directly adverse to Enron's in=\r\nterests in a proceeding in which Enron was a major participant and which we=\r\n knew going into the proceedings at the start that our representation would=\r\n be adverse to Enron.\r\n\r\nAs Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have be=\r\nen adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see=\r\n \"eye to eye\" with Enron on all of the issues.  These generally have been s=\r\nituations involving historical client relationships that go back decades wh=\r\nere Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been i=\r\nncredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those pro=\r\nceedings.  Nonetheless, I am trying to do whatever I can to try to eliminat=\r\ne or reduce the number of those situations on a going forward basis, althou=\r\ngh I know I will not be able to eliminate all of them in light of the size =\r\nof our Firm and the diverse nature of its client base.\r\n\r\nJeff, I will follow up with you personally, but I just wanted to drop you a=\r\n quick note to thank you for the time and thought you devoted to this.

Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.  If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., \"Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for\"), it would really bring the house down.

Thanks.\nBest,\nJeff\n\nState PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts \nDeals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators \nIn a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. \nThe state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. \n\"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,\" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. \"I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.\" \nThe PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n\"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. \nHidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. \n\"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,\" Hidalgo said. \"If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.\" \nThe state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. \nHidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. \nOver the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. \nSEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS\nTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. \nThe deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. \nGallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. \nDavis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. \nThe PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. \nThe commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. \nSTATE TREASURER'S WARNING\nState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. \nPUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. \n\"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,\" Lynch said last week. \"We should stay as flexible as possible. \nLynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. \nCommissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. \n\"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,\" he said. \"Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.\" \nHidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. \nJan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. \n\"Now another California agency is disputing it,\" Mitchell said. \"We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.\" \nPUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS\nThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. \n\"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,\" the PUC said. \nAn energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. \nUncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. \nWhile officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. \n***************************************************","To":["pr<.palmer@enron.com>"],"cont_length":1358,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 09:51:08 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<15996888.1075851619794.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: It seems to be unraveling for Davis--Need Ron or Dan to get CPUC Filings at FERC"},{"content":"Thanks.

Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. \n\"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,\" Ahern said. \"It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover.\" \nThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc.

Thanks.\nBest,\nJeff\n\nState PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts \nDeals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators \nIn a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. \nThe state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. \n\"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,\" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. \"I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.\" \nThe PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n\"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. \nHidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. \n\"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,\" Hidalgo said. \"If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.\" \nThe state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. \nHidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. \nOver the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. \nSEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS\nTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. \nThe deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. \nGallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. \nDavis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. \nThe PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. \nThe commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. \nSTATE TREASURER'S WARNING\nState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. \nPUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. \n\"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,\" Lynch said last week. \"We should stay as flexible as possible. \nLynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. \nCommissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. \n\"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,\" he said. \"Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.\" \nHidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. \nJan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. \n\"Now another California agency is disputing it,\" Mitchell said. \"We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.\" \nPUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS\nThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. \n\"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,\" the PUC said. \nAn energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. \nUncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. \nWhile officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. \n***************************************************","To":["ray.alvarez@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com"],"cont_length":1233,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 14:18:31 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<24829045.1075851620105.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: It seems to be unraveling for Davis--Need Ron or Dan to get CPUC Filings at FERC"},{"content":"Doesn't look good.\n\nUSA: Shares of NewPower plummet in midday trade.\n\n10/01/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity provider NewPower Holdings were down almost 20 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, but the company had no comment on the share drop. \nShares of NewPower were down 55 cents, or 17.9 percent, to $2.53 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"We don't comment on stock activity.

However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:\nSome agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.\nSome agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.\nSome agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.\n\nWe agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.\n\nMight be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them.

However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:\nSome agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.\nSome agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.\nSome agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.\n\nWe agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.\n\nMight be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.\n\nAny comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.

Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of\nthe bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power\npurchase revenues and no other repayment source.\n? Designed as a \"net revenue bond,\" meaning bondholders are paid last and\nall other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.  In order to sell net\nrevenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1)\ncarry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off\nthe bonds.  As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the\noverall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the\noverall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by\nratepayers for 15 years.\n? Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in\nplace and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least\nthe next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will\ngenerate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs\nfor the life of the bonds.  \n? Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the\nbonds are outstanding.\n\n\nThe Rate Agreement\n? Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends\nover a revenue requirement.  The Commission is limited only to correcting\nmathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.  If the\nCommission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue\ncalculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates\nestablished at a level that satisfies DWR.\n? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power\nand deliver it to customers in their service territories before the\nutilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each\nservice territory. \n? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of\ntheir customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the\nstate must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the\nrequirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whatever\nrevenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in\nthe power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.  \n? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to\nchange the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program \"sunset\" at the\nend of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern about\nthis provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested\nthat an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to\ncontinue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through\nCommission-approved revenue requirements.\n? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state\nduring the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being\nexercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals\nwill be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the\nState.\n? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term\ncontracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of those\ncontracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would\nnot be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that\nwould reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts.\n? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and\ncollect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for\nfailure to pay for electricity provided by DWR.\n? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter\nor modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likely\nneed to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remains\nin effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds\nare issued.   \n\n\nThe Challenges to the Rate Agreement\n? Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement.\n? Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the State\nTreasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction.\n? Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement,\nincluding:\n\to The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR's\nrevenue requirement \n\to Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law,\nand outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power  \n\to DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegal\nbecause they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWR\nOppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has the\nphysical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution\nnetworks.","To":["drothrock@cmta.net"],"cont_length":795,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 17:21:25 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<24662859.1075851620346.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: CPUC Press Conference -- Lynch announces will vote against the DWR Rate agreement"},{"content":"Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity \n \nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. \n\nThe Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies\n\nWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,\" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. \"If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void.\" \nThree weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. \n\n\"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,\" Ahern said. \"It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover.\" \n\nThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. \n\nThe Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. \n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. \n\nThe CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \n\nCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. \n\nBudhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report. \n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dorothy Rothrock [mailto:drothrock@cmta.net]\nSent: Monday, October 01, 2001 7:07 PM\nTo: Dasovich, Jeff\nSubject: [Fwd: Letter to Loretta Lynch on rate agreement]\n\n\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: Letter to Loretta Lynch on rate agreement\nDate: Mon, 1 Oct 2001 14:31:15 -0700\nFrom: lkaye@ka-pow.com\nTo:\njstewart@cmta.net,bhauck@cbrt.org,Bill_Dombrowski@ka-pow.com,jeanne.cain@calchamber.com,\"DiMare,\nDominic\"\n<Dominic.DiMare@calchamber.com>,Dorothy_Rothrock@ka-pow.com,kclark@cbrt.org,Derek_Naten@ka-pow.com,Bill_Booth@ka-pow.com,DJ_Smith@ka-pow.com,CPRG_Meeting@ka-pow.com,Evelyn_Kahl@ka-pow.com\nCC: thull@ka-pow.com,David_Fogarty@ka-pow.com,Al_Lundeen@ka-pow.com\n\nAttached is a letter faxed today to Commissioner Lynch from Californians\nfor Energy Action opposing adoption of the proposed DWR rate agreement.\n\n(See attached file: PUC letter 10.1.01,rev 2.doc)","To":["drothrock@cmta.net"],"cont_length":698,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 17:24:10 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<10779737.1075851620370.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: [Fwd: Letter to Loretta Lynch on rate agreement]"},{"content":"FYI.

This year's theme, \"Explore, Inspire, Excel,\" is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. \n\nThe annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.\n\nDubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.\n\nBeth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address. \n\nSawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book \"Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World,\" published by Hyperion in February 2000.

However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:\nSome agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.\nSome agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.\nSome agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.\n\nWe agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.\n\nMight be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.\n\nAny comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.\n\nBest,\nJeff","To":["b..sanders@enron.com"],"cont_length":509,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Tue, 2 Oct 2001 08:36:45 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<11851662.1075851620509.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit"},{"content":"I'm real sorry to bug you with this, but you and I will need to do some research so that I can make sure that I'm reporting properly.

Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. \n\"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,\" Ahern said. \"It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover.\" \nThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. \nThe Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. \nThe California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. \nThe CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \nCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30.

The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \nCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.","To":["f..calger@enron.com"],"cont_length":760,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Tue, 2 Oct 2001 11:11:50 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<6353677.1075851620809.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Vikram Under Fire"},{"content":"For you, anything.

The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:\n?\tEdison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.\n?\tEdison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.\n?\tEdison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.\n?\tThe PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. \n?\tThe PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.\n?\tThe PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. \n?\tThere are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.\n?\tEdison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.\n\"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,\" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  \"The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.\"\nThis agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDasovich, Jeff  \nSent:\tTuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

Their settlement has protected the public\ninterest, and will allow the State's second largest utility to return to\nfinancial health. I am pleased to hear the PUC's assurance that this can be\naccomplished without a rate hike.\n\n\"In light of the agreement between the PUC and Edison, there is no need for\nthe Legislature to return next week for a special session. Therefore, I am\nrescinding my call for the Third Extraordinary Session.\n\n\"In January, the Legislature passed AB 1X which authorized the State to\npurchase power since our two largest utilities were brought to their\nfinancial knees by runaway wholesale energy costs. Despite long odds, the\nState was able to keep the lights on this summer and has spent approximately\n$6.1 billion from the General Fund and $5 billion from the DWR Power Fund\ndoing so. AB 1X envisioned the sale of revenue bonds to repay the General\nFund with interest.\n\n\"The Public Utilities Commission's refusal today to adopt the rate agreement\nnecessary for the bonds to be sold was an irresponsible act. It creates\nuncertainty about our ability to sell the bonds necessary to repay the\nGeneral Fund when California can least afford additional fiscal uncertainty.\nIn fact, preliminary financial estimates show that State revenues are $1.1\nbillion short of budget projections.","To":["pr<.palmer@enron.com>"],"cont_length":338,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Tue, 2 Oct 2001 16:15:35 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<19037215.1075851621256.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Special Session Canceled"},{"content":"FYI.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: MDay [mailto:MDay@GMSSR.com]\nSent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 6:35 PM\nTo: 'Jeff Dasovich Enron SF'; 'Jim Steffes, Enron'; Kaufman, Paul;\nSanders, Richard B.; 'Rick Shapiro, Enron Houston'; 'Sue Mara at Enron\nSF'; Williams, Robert C.\nSubject: FW: Notice of Settlement with SCE (A.00-11-038, et al.

The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.\n\nNow, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.\n\nSTOCK PRICE\n\nWe are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:\n---\tA decline in the overall market and economy;\n---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;\n---   A \"meltdown\" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;\n---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and\n---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.\n\nThese concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.\n\n---\tOver the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.\n---\tWe have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.\nWe also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:\n---\tMark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.\n--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.\n\nTHE PRC\n\nThe relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.\n\nTherefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:\n---\tEffective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.\n---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.\n---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.\n---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.\n\nIn the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.\n\nEMPLOYEE MORALE\n\nWe believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.\n---\tWe are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.\nOver the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.\n---\tWe will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.\n---\tAdditionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.\n\nEXTERNAL REPUTATION\n\nWe all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:\n---\tWe will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.\n--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.\n\nINTEGRITY & RESPECT\n\nI believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.\n---\tEnron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.\n---\tWe will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.\n---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.\n\nFinally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.","To":["michael.tribolet@enron.com"],"cont_length":1818,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Wed, 3 Oct 2001 11:36:31 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<497741.1075851621585.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Lay It On the Line Survey Results"},{"content":"Thanks.

A ruling is expected by Thursday. \nBryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. \n\"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point,\" Bryson said. \"We will engage promptly\" in settlement discussions. \"We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way.\" \nTed Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. \nBryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade \"immediately.\" \n\"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies,\" Bryson said. \"But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time.\" \nBryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate. \n     \nStephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. \nBryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt. \nThe utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. \n\"In the month of October we generated about $300 million\" from retail rates. But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. \nThe utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. \nBryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC. \n     \nFearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. \nThe negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said. \nThe end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.","To":["j..kean@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com"],"cont_length":621,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Wed, 3 Oct 2001 15:28:54 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<13630087.1075851621656.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet"},{"content":"Thank you Robert for pointing that out.

They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up.\"\n\"Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: \"the palace coup.\" \nLawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. \nThe central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. \nWinter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. \n\"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,\" said Dunn. \nThe subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. \nDavis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt \"betrayed\" by the actions of Winter. \n\"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,\" Maviglio said. \nWinter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. \n\"It was an emergency,\" Fishman said. \n\"We had to take action.'' \nWhat became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. \n\"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,\" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. \n\"All hell broke loose.'' \nRecords show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. \n\"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. \nAlthough there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to \"fix\" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. \nIn the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. \nThe generators got their way. \nThe next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. \nPower producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. \nThey began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. \nWhat followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. \nWinter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. \nNeither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. \n\"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. \nWith the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. \n\"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. \"It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business.\" \nPrices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. \nDunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. \nRobinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. \nRobinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. \n\"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. \"In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund.\" \nJan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. \n\"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. \n\"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing.\" \nThe ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. \nJames J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. \n\"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. \n\"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do.\" \nWhat Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. \n\"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,\" Dunn said. \"Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''","To":["mlk@pkns.com"],"cont_length":1319,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Fri, 5 Oct 2001 14:01:48 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<10630348.1075851622009.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Dunn and Davis Searching for a New Scapegoat"},{"content":"-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDasovich, Jeff  \nSent:\tSaturday, October 06, 2001 2:44 PM\nTo:\t'jdasovich@sbcglobal.net'\nSubject:","To":["jeff.dasovich@enron.com"],"cont_length":18,"Week_number":"39","Date":"Sat, 6 Oct 2001 12:46:25 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<20465052.1075851622032.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW:"},{"content":"Thanks.

He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. \n\nToday, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. \n\nDavis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. \n\nThe seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. \n\nDavis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. \n\nHow big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. \n\nHowever large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. \n\nIt's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. \n\nThe effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned. \n\n  _____  \n\nThe Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>.","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","d..steffes@enron.com","m..landwehr@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com"],"cont_length":705,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Sun, 7 Oct 2001 08:39:40 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<14339754.1075852594522.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets"},{"content":"Atlanta-6\nSD-4\nMiamia-8\nMinn-3\nNYG-12\nPhil-13\nPitt-2\nBalt-5\nJack-11\nDenver-9\nNYJ-10\nOak-14\nGB-7\nSF-1\nSt. Louis-15","To":["eldon@direcpc.com"],"cont_length":31,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Sun, 7 Oct 2001 09:40:53 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<28528209.1075852594498.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"No problem.

That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. \nMany observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. \n\"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. \nA draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. \nWithout the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. \nIn a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. \nPower authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. \"The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. \nSaid Freeman: \"We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.\" \nNew contracts would increase 'green' power \nIn addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. \nSuch generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. \nThe remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called \"peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. \nThe emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. \nNonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. \n\"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. \nBusinesses worry new pacts will hurt them \nEven the state's businesses are critical. \nThey believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. \nLawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. \nLawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. \n\"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. \nThe state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies.

Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away....\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n****************************************************\nPUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal\nPolitics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.\nSACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.\n\nWith the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.\n\nAlthough Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. \"I will take responsibility,\" Lynch said.\n\nEven as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as \"an irresponsible act.\"\n\nDavis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.\n\nSuch actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.\n\nAnd yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.\n\nFor months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.\n\nDavis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as \"nonexistent.\"\n\nBut floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.\n\nDavis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but \"he can't remove commissioners,\" said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. \"We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate.\"\n\nA Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.\n\nLynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.\n\nShe recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned \"an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing.\"\n\n\"Before, I was on [Davis'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss,\" Lynch said. \"Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence.\"\n\nCritics, including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.\n\nInsisting on Independence\n\nAccounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.\n\nStarting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison, Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. Davis had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.\n\nLynch was another skeptic; Davis' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate Edison. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.\n\nDavis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill.\n\nThe governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.\n\nLynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edison's debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers.\n\nIt was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.\n\n\"When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed,\" enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.\n\nAt her direction, PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison.\n\nEdison, PUC Started Secret Talks\n\nEdison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nBut with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.\n\nThe PUC had three conditions. \"One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period,\" Cohen said. \"Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority.\"\n\nLynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edison's problem.\n\nLynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 \"in the strictest confidence\" about the negotiations with Edison.\n\n\"If it became public, it could blow up,\" Brown said. \"There would be too much hullabaloo.\"\n\nFor several days, however, Lynch did not inform Davis. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.\n\nOn Sept. 25, some of Davis' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.\n\nThat same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.\n\nOver the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.\n\n\"It would not have gotten over the finish line without her,\" said attorney Ron Olson, an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.\n\nWhile those negotiations were going on, Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.\n\nThe issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers.\n\nLynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.\n\nThe PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nKnowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque.\n\nThe governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.\n\nBut his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson.\n\nCommissioners Praise Lynch\n\nIn Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.\n\n\"There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type,\" Bilas said.\n\nBrown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.\n\n\"She stood up for the authority of the PUC,\" Brown said. Brown--a cousin of Davis' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.\n\n\"I hope they don't remove her as president,\" Brown said. \"She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit.\"","To":["mday@gmssr.com"],"cont_length":1792,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 10:16:13 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<1791733.1075851622170.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Please note name of venue.\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Bob Hillman [mailto:bhillman@earthlink.net]\nSent: Thursday, October 04, 2001 4:56 PM\nTo: bhillman@earthlink.net\nSubject: Bob Hillman in Emeryville 10/10\n\n\nDear Everyone,\n \nI will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th.

The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. \n\"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,\" Shames said. \nShames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. \nNow it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. \nBeyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. \nHe says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. \n\"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,\" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. \"There were other means to manage the emergency.\" \nThe PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. \n\"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,\" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.\nWillingness to deal\nAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. \nThe federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are \"just and reasonable.\" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. \nCohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. \nFor his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. \n\"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,\" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. \"We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone.\" \nSome experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. \nPower providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. \n\"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,\" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. \nThe San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. \nSempra says contract fair\nThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. \nSan Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. \nMichael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. \n\"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' \" Niggli said. \nBut V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. \nWhite says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. \n\"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,\" White said. \"The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. \n\"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?\" \nState authority buying more power for 2002 \nCritics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss \nSACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. \nMoreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. \nThe new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. \nMany observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. \n\"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. \nA draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. \nWithout the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. \nIn a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. \nPower authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. \"The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. \nSaid Freeman: \"We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.\" \nNew contracts would increase 'green' power \nIn addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. \nSuch generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. \nThe remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called \"peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. \nThe emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. \nNonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. \n\"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. \nBusinesses worry new pacts will hurt them \nEven the state's businesses are critical. \nThey believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. \nLawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. \nLawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. \n\"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. \nThe state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. \nThe Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. \n\"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But \"it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' \nKeeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. \nFreeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. \n\"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. \"Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''","To":["michael.tribolet@enron.com"],"cont_length":2145,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 11:00:10 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<18209521.1075851622244.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Thanks so much for the Storybook wine.

Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. \nAll of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the \"energy crisis,\" an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. \nWhen the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. \nLast January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. \nAt Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. \nSince then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. \nAdministration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. \nA lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. \nThat may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. \nBy doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. \nHolding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. \nMaybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.","To":["linda.robertson@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>"],"cont_length":700,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Tue, 9 Oct 2001 08:20:10 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<747220.1075851622480.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Conspiracy?:  Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?"},{"content":"Power providers cry foul over fees \nState is accused of improper billing \nElectricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. \nThe power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. \nEnergy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. \nThe charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. \n\"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,\" Smutney-Jones said. \nAn industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. \nThe commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. \nState officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. \nGary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to \"bury\" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. \n\"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,\" Ackerman said. \nThe governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations \"absolutely false\" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. \n\"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,\" Maviglio said. \"It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement.\" \nOscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. \n\"I don't feel sorry for them one bit,\" Hidalgo said. \"They had one heck of a year.\" \nGregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. \nEnergy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. \nThe extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. \nSome firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. \nThe accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. \nIn February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become \"a political arm of the governor.\" The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. \nDavis has warned Washington to \"keep its hands off\" the ISO.","To":["sarah.novosel@enron.com","l..nicolay@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","pat.shortridge@enron.com","dave.perrino@enron.com","alan.comnes@enron.com","m..landwehr@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","karen.denne@enron.com","pr<.palmer@enron.com>","steve.walton@enron.com"],"cont_length":680,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Tue, 9 Oct 2001 08:23:06 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<9183158.1075851622505.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Power providers cry foul over fees -- Cal ISO/DWR price manipulation?"},{"content":"Dear Ms DSL:\n\nLooks like no DWR meeting this week.

Tough break.  Is the judge's proposed decision available?\nBest,\nJeff\nFERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso\nWASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . \nThe ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. \n\"While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power,\" Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. \nThe California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. \nIn a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's \"standards of conduct\" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. \n\"El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse,\" Wagner concluded. \n\"There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding\" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. \nFERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. \nThe proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. \n\"The briefs measured approximately one linear foot,\" he said. \n \n     Contracting With Affiliates \n   \nAt issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. \nCalifornia argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. \nThe contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. \nThe judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. \nBut while that market share gave El Paso the \"ability to exercise market power,\" Wagner said, \"it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power.\" \nThe record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. \nFrom March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. \nWagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power. \n \n     Improper Communications Seen \n   \nWhere the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. \nWagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. \nTranscripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso \"demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service\" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. \nWagner determined that the transcript offered a \"prima facie\" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. \nWagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates \"were in clear violation\" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. \nEl Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a \"legal error\" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. \nThe parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. \nHowever the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court.","To":["joe.hartsoe@enron.com","leslie.lawner@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","ray.alvarez@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","sarah.novosel@enron.com","w..cantrell@enron.com"],"cont_length":910,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 07:55:25 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<23238002.1075851622902.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso"},{"content":"Thanks.

PG&E and SDG&E submitted a joint letter which basically set\nforth what they had done to date and their progress of working with the\nESPs.  They stated that they anticipated filing a joint proposal with the\nESPs soon.  SCE, however, was more specific in its submission.  Therein, SCE\nstates that \"SCE will not accept connect DASRs after October 20, 2001.\" The\nsubmittal also states that \"SCE will not process connect DASRs for service\naccounts which did not exist on September 20, 2001.\"\n\n3. On October 9th, a conference call was held between SDG&E, PG&E, Enron,\nCommonwealth, NewWest and UC/CSU.  At that time, SDG&E and PG&E informed the\nESPs that they would not be able to file a joint proposal.  That, instead,\nthey would be filing an advice letter (probably joint between the two UDCs)\nwhich proposed a connect DASR cut off date. While a definitive date was not\nstated, they indicated that it would be around the end of the year.\n\n4. PG&E and SDG&E stated that they would file such advice letters by the end\nof the week.  Parties would have approximately 10 days to respond.","To":["susan.mara@enron.com","c..williams@enron.com","mike.smith@enron.com","mike.smith@enron.com","andrew.wu@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","harry.kingerski@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com"],"cont_length":401,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 10:06:51 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<14746248.1075851622952.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Update on the Implementation of the Suspension of Direct Access"},{"content":"FYI.

The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. \nSome commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' \nMoody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. \nThe state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. \nDavis `Willing to Discuss' \n``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. \nDavis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. \nPower generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' \nThe planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. \n`A Blank Check' \nUnder state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. \nPUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. \n``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. \nThe commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. \n``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. \nThe new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. \nCritics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. \nNo matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''","To":["f..calger@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","david.parquet@enron.com"],"cont_length":702,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 14:41:12 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<24785575.1075851623215.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says; DWR Contract Renegotiation Is Key"},{"content":"keep up the good work!

They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan,\" Cohen said. \n\"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation,\" said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \nPG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. \nTremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. \nPG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. \nThe CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. \nThey point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was \"undervalued in today's market\" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. \nThe PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. \nSoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.","To":["michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com"],"cont_length":794,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 14:50:30 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<7774867.1075851623262.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif"},{"content":"Jean:  We're on the job, trying to get the number.

The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. \nSome commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' \nMoody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. \nThe state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. \nDavis `Willing to Discuss' \n``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. \nDavis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. \nPower generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' \nThe planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. \n`A Blank Check' \nUnder state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. \nPUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. \n``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. \nThe commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. \n``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. \nThe new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. \nCritics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. \nNo matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''","To":["f..calger@enron.com"],"cont_length":798,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Thu, 11 Oct 2001 10:44:27 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<15068294.1075851623473.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says; DWR Contract Renegotiation Is Key"},{"content":"FYI.\n\nNevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts \nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. \nThe contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. \n\"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,\" Soderberg said. \nNo one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. \nThe PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. \nThe General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. \nSierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. \nCalifornia 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.","To":["f..calger@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com"],"cont_length":305,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Thu, 11 Oct 2001 10:47:56 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<17528263.1075851623497.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts"},{"content":"Davis devises new borrowing plan \nHis executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. \nSACRAMENTO -- Gov.

Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by\nsome critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion\nshortfall in other income. \n\n\n>  \n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\nthe intended recipient (s).

Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. \nThe General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. \nSierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. \nCalifornia 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.","To":["david.parquet@enron.com","michael.mcdonald@enron.com"],"cont_length":338,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Thu, 11 Oct 2001 11:27:05 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<16176939.1075851623713.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts"},{"content":"just faxed it.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Joseph Tambornino [mailto:josephtambornino@yahoo.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 1:46 PM\nTo: Dasovich, Jeff\nSubject: RE: Yesterday's Class\n\n\nIt's not on Izio, so if you could fax it, that would\nbe super.

What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks.\nBest,\nJeff\nEdison pact could point way for PG&E \nThe multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. \nIt might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. \nThe pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. \nAlong with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. \nOne week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. \nFrom the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. \nIt was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. \n\"It's definitely ambiguously worded,\" said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. \n\"There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers,\" Linsey said. \nThe PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. \nIn addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. \nAnd the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. \nAbout three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. \nEdison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. \nThe clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. \nAnother $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. \n\"In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers,\" said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. \nBut if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. \nNo one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? \nPartly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. \nThe PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. \n\"People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did,\" said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. \"It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'\" \nThe reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. \nThat prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. \nThey plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. \n\"They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'\" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. \nFor its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. \nPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. \n\"I think it would be smarter to be talking now,\" he said. \nA PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. \nConsumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. \n\"We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power,\" Cohen said. \nMost people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. \nCohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. \nAt a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. \nIt is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. \n\"It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this,\" said Florio, the consumer advocate. \"This could be the beginning of something really ugly.\" \nIn addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.","To":["michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com"],"cont_length":1301,"Week_number":"40","Date":"Fri, 12 Oct 2001 10:07:30 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<1419201.1075851624375.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Edison pact could point way for PG&E"},{"content":"Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, comments, etc.?\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMara, Susan  \nSent:\tFriday, October 12, 2001 12:13 PM\nTo:\tDasovich, Jeff; Steffes, James D.; Swain, Steve\nSubject:\tRE: CA question\n\nAll,\n\nI think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 \"RAP\" case three years ago.

During the course of the proceeding, we\nconvinced ourselves that he would rule our way due to the vast evidence in\nour favor and the relatively inept presentation of El Paso and El Paso\nMerchant Energy.  Well, despite the voluminous record in support of our\nposition, the judge ruled that it was \"not at all clear\" that El Paso\nexercised market power.  The good news for your affiliates is that, if the\nCommission does not find the exercise of market power in this case, it\nnever will.  We hope when the Commission reviews the entire record,\nincluding the \"protected material\", they will change the ALJ's finding.  On\nsome level we believe that the ALJ just does not like California.  He is\nthe judge, after all, who told Harold Ray in the electric generation\nsettlement discussions that he was \"an asshole\".  The ironic part of the\ndecision is that we felt that a determination by the ALJ that defined the\nmarket in such a way as to preclude EPME having market power would be\ndifficult to overcome at the Commission level.  Instead, he defined the\nmarket as we suggested and found that El Paso had market power; he simply\nfailed to be convinced that they were withholding capacity despite the fact\nthat they utilized their capacity 54% of the time when everyone else was\nutilizing their own capacity at a capacity factor of between 85% and 90%.\nGo figure.\n\nI am still less than enchanted with the NGS settlement  after SoCalGas\ntailored it to their interests but am glad that the Commission is at least\nconsidering opening up the system ala PG&E.   I think that they are\nreasonably aware that SoCalGas was not blameless in the runup in gas prices\nthat took place last December.   Having said that we are having a hell of a\ntime in the GCIM simply trying to investigate what really happened.\nSoCalGas latest excuse for not giving us info is that we will \"competitors\"\nwith them (as a result of the filed rate litigation) for gas hedges.  I\nmust have misunderstood; I did not realize there was a limited supply of\nhedges available and that there was competition for those \"available\"\nhedges.

The\nagreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for\nEdison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume\npower procurement responsibilities.\n* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be\nrecovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a\nbridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.\n* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides\napparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be\ntiming of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will\nlikely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas\nprices.\n* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated\nsettlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which\nEdison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action\nto recover alleged generator overcharges.\n* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree\non the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially\nrelease Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as\nopposed to through the PX/ISO.\n* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few\nweeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.\n* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether\nor not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up\nas a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility\nretained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.\n* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about\nthe earnings impact of the Edison settlement.

The\nagreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for\nEdison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume\npower procurement responsibilities.\n* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be\nrecovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a\nbridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.\n* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides\napparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be\ntiming of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will\nlikely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas\nprices.\n* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated\nsettlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which\nEdison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action\nto recover alleged generator overcharges.\n* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree\non the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially\nrelease Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as\nopposed to through the PX/ISO.\n* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few\nweeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.\n* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether\nor not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up\nas a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility\nretained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.\n* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about\nthe earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are\nsticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and\n$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential\nupside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are\nrestored under the terms of the settlement agreement.\n* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average\nmultiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although\nclarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst.","To":["michael.tribolet@enron.com"],"cont_length":662,"Week_number":"41","Date":"Mon, 15 Oct 2001 09:48:25 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<18867868.1075851624805.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: ML Power Group-EIX-Update Following Meeting With Management"},{"content":"No problem.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: eldon [mailto:eldon@direcpc.com]\nSent: Saturday, October 13, 2001 5:40 PM\nTo: Dasovich, Jeff\nSubject: RE: News Flash!\n\n\nThanks for sending this to me.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff [mailto:Jeff.Dasovich@ENRON.com]\nSent: Friday, October 12, 2001 3:21 PM\nTo: Nancy Sellers (E-mail); eldon sellers (E-mail); Scott Laughlin\n(E-mail); psellers@pacbell.net; cameron@perfect.com\nSubject: News Flash!\n\n\nPlayboy Online staff cutbacks\n\nPlayboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in \nits online division, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Eldon and Nancy:  Here's the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on \"just wars.\"  Sort of thought-provoking.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\nOctober 11, 2001\nCommentary\nEven Pacifists Must\nSupport This War\n\nBy Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's \"Weekend Edition With Scott Simon.\"\n\nPacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.\n\nPacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.\n\nI worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.\nBut in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.\n\nIt seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.\n\nSome peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.\n\nThis is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.\n\nIn 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: \"Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country.\"\n\nVon Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.\n\nIn short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.\n\nAnd what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?\n\nPacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.\n\nBut those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.\nOnly American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.\n \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: eldon [mailto:eldon@direcpc.com]\nSent: Monday, October 15, 2001 1:45 PM\nTo: Cameron Sellers (E-mail); Dotty Hopkins (E-mail); Nancy Sellers\n(E-mail); Nancy Sellers (E-mail); Prentice Sellers (E-mail 2); Rory\nSellers (E-mail); Scott Laughlin (E-mail); Dasovich, Jeff; William K.\nSellers (E-mail); cptjack@napanet.net\nSubject: Having trouble 'getting back to normal' \n\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n--Ethics Matters columnist Carlton Vogt on the ethical\nimplications of President Bush's decision that civilian\nairliners that are perceived to be a threat to the general\npopulation should be shot down.\n\nhttp://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/01/10/08/011008opethics.xml?1015mnl\nv\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWhat do you think about this?

Some interesting tid-bits from CMTA.\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Geri L. Royer [mailto:groyer@cmta.net]\nSent: Monday, October 15, 2001 2:43 PM\nCc: Royer, Geri\nSubject: CMTA Legislative Weekly - 10/15/01\n\n\nThe CMTA Fall Conference scheduled for \nOctober 30 - November 2 has been canceled. \n\n  _____  \n\nLegislative Weekly \nOctober 15, 2001 \nIssue 40, Volume 3 \n\nA weekly publication from the \nCalifornia Manufacturers & Technology Association \ndetailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento\n\nECONOMIC SUMMIT \n\nIn the wake of repeated economic blows on the state's business community and announcements of losses, layoffs and declining tax revenues, the Governor has stated his intention to hold an Economic Summit in early November with business and labor leaders, and professional economists to identify and discuss measures to stimulate California's economy.   The date and participants will be announced this week.  Governor Davis is also considering the possibility of calling a Special Legislative Session to enact such measures immediately.   In an effort to avoid or minimize a looming State budget deficit, the Department of Finance has instructed state agencies to cut their budgets by 15%. \n\nCMTA's members are devising a priority list of policies that should be adopted to help mitigate the effects of the international economic cooling and hopefully, stave-off recession in this state. \n\nPOWER AUTHORITY MEETING \n\nRenewables and the Power Authority \nAt an October 5 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) meeting in San Francisco, Chairman David Freeman acknowledged that renewable peaking capacity may comprise a significant portion of the 15 percent reserve the Authority expects to establish to prevent future price spikes in the cost of electricity. \n\nFreeman indicated that the Authority has received proposals for 18,000 MW in peaker capacity, which have been evaluated and winnowed down to 3,000 MW.  While commitments to build these peaker facilities have not yet been formalized, the Power Authority is moving forward with proposals for a few hundred renewable megawatts. \n\nFreeman also indicated that at least two state biomass plants are at risk of shutting down.  He believes that these plants should continue to run, despite the high costs associated with this market.  Power Authority staff has been asked to look at options to keep the plants operating, and to report back to the Power Authority. \n\nBoard member Donald Vial expressed concern at the way in which the Power Authority is looking at the 15 percent reserve.  He believes that the reserve should be a working capacity margin used to phase out dirty plants and to move into, and to promote renewables. \n\nBoard member John Stevens pointed out that the Power Authority has limited funding with which to purchase peaking capacity, and reminded the members that any plan must reasonably balance the costs associated with the generation capacity. \n\nDepartment of Water Resources Update \nThe Power Authority also received a report from staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR) who indicated that the Department is looking at load curtailment, renewables and new supplies that ideally are north of Path 15.  The Department believes it has been instrumental in keeping the spot market under control and minimizing the number of blackouts experienced this summer.  The Department also gave a great deal of credit to customers who have been instrumental in preventing blackouts through conservation. \n\nThe Department will be updating its energy portfolio needs, and posting its information on its website at www.cers.water.ca.gov, sometime next week. \n\nPublic Utilities Commission Natural Gas Infrastructure Report \nBarbara Hale, the Director of Strategic Planning at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) provided an update on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report that is due to the Power Authority by November 15.  Ms. Hale indicated that the PUC is working with the California Energy Commission (CEC) to evaluate the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure, including interstate pipelines, intrastate pipelines, local distribution, storage and backbone.  The PUC fully expects to have the report finalized and ready to deliver to the Power Authority by November 15. \n\nPreliminary findings indicate that in-ground storage is at 85 percent of capacity, a healthy margin to meet demands through the winter.  While there still is room to inject additional natural gas, the PUC is expecting a moderate winter with low gas demand. \nChairman Freeman requested that the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report also include a forecast of natural gas availability from the lower 48 states and Canada, as well as whether or not California may depend on these sources to meet its needs. \n\nBoard Member Vial questioned if the unbundling of storage has been successful.  Ms. Hale replied that the PUC is monitoring non-core use, and that preliminary findings indicate that many non-core customers are increasing their use of storage. \n\nActivities Related to Renewable Energy and Conservation \nStaff at the Power Authority reported that coordination between the PUC and the Power Authority is necessary to optimize conservation, energy efficiency, and demand response.  Specifically, the Power Authority is putting together a residential loan program; financing for efficiencies in public buildings; and, financing for small commercial and industrial upgrades.  The Power Authority believes that the small commercial and industrial market is the most under-served, due to the multiple demands on owners and their lack of resources.  The Power Authority is looking at ways to assist these customers in retrofitting their facilities. \n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the Power Authority believes that large commercial and industrial customers require the least assistance.  The Power Authority believes these customers are well served under current programs, but acknowledged that many of the demand response programs would be better coordinated under the administration of just one agency. \n\nFinally, Board Member Vial questioned why there has been little emphasis on real time pricing.  Power Authority staff agreed that real time pricing has not been a priority, and that the infrastructure to implement a real time pricing program does not currently exist.  Staff did indicate, however, that a recent $35 million investment in meters should help to incentivize these programs. \n\nFreeman concluded that it is important for the Power Authority to build on the momentum of conservation, and he acknowledged that technology finally is being priced such that real time pricing makes sense and likely will be an integral part of the Power Authority's program. \n\nLaura Doll Named as New Executive Director \nLaura Doll of Austin, Texas was approved as the Chief Executive Officer of the Power Authority at the October 5 Board meeting.  Most recently, Doll was Director of Customer Service for Grande Communications.  She also has held the positions of Senior Vice President for Planergy, as well as Chief Administrative Officer for Austin Energy.  Doll received a master of public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin, and a bachelor of arts degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  She will receive an annual salary of $200,000. \n\nCOMPUTER RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY BILL VETOED (AGAIN) \n\nGovernor Davis vetoed SB 147 by Senator Debra Bowen (D-Marina Del Rey) on October 8.  The bill would have required employers to prepare and distribute by hard copy or electronically, a company monitoring policies and practices notice to each employee, to collect and verify their understanding of the notice, and file and maintain each employee's signed notice indefinitely.  This is the third time Senator Bowen's notice bill has been vetoed by the Governor and we hope that the bill has struck out. \n\nIn his veto message, the governor referred to some of the concerns expressed by employers such as the need to monitor and control the use of company property for business purposes.  Also employers are potentially liable for the misuse of computers for improper purposes, such as sexual harassment, defamation and the like, so employers have a legitimate reason to monitor e-mail and computer files from time to time. \n\nThe Governor said in closing his veto message, \" I support reasonable privacy protections for employees in the workplace and my Administration proposed amendments which would carry out the intent of the bill without imposing undue regulatory burdens and potential legal exposure to businesses for doing what any employee should assume is the employer's right when they accept employment.  Senator Bowen rejected the proposed amendments. Thus, I must veto the bill a third time.\" \n\nThis is a significant victory for employers.  The bill had the potential to open up Pandora's box on employee notices in the workplace by greatly expanding the scope, confirmation and tracking of notices.  CMTA applauds the Governor's veto of SB 147. \n\nGOVERNOR SIGNS MERCURY LEGISLATION \n\nGovernor Davis has signed legislation to place new controls on products containing mercury.  SB 633 by Senator Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) places new controls on the disposal of appliance and vehicle components found to contain mercury. \n\n\"I am signing this bill because it will help reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded thermometers, novelty products, and by mercury-containing electrical switches that are not removed before junked vehicles are crushed or shredded,\" said Davis. \n\nSB 633 also bans the sale of new automobiles in California after January 1, 2005 that contain mercury electrical switches. \n  \n\nLATE BREAKING NEWS: \n\nSB 71 (Burton D-San Francisco), Workers' Compensation, vetoed by the Governor. \n  \n\nwww.cmta.net <http://www.cmta.net/> \nCalifornia Manufacturers & Technology Association \n980 9th Street, Suite 2200 \nSacramento, CA  95814 \n(916) 441-5420 phone \n(916) 447-9401 fax \n\nYou are receiving this message today because your company is a valued member of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA).

It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.\n\nAs we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.  The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.  As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.  I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.  I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.  Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.\n\nJeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.\n\nThanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest Regards,\nMike\n\n\n << File: Dual Auction PG&E.ppt >>  << File: Dual Auction SCE.ppt >> \nMike Etringer                         503.464.3836 (w)\nEnron North America                            503.701.4516 (c)\nWest Power Origination                       503.464.3740 (fax)\n121 SW Salmon Street 3WTC0306       michael.etringer@enron.com\nPortland, OR 97232","To":["michael.etringer@enron.com"],"cont_length":295,"Week_number":"41","Date":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 08:35:31 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<10698912.1075851625394.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Dual Auction Restructuring"},{"content":"Sounds like a plan.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMontovano, Steve  \nSent:\tTuesday, October 16, 2001 11:12 AM\nTo:\tSteffes, James D.; Dasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: November Direct Report Meeting Changes\n\nI would suggest that we get a handle on the weather prior to committing.

Bilas as requested. In view\nof the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the\ncurrent 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary\nof the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :\n\n\n1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt\npoint capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration\nhistorically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will\nbe successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits\nin the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any\nmisbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44\n\n2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized\nfirm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.\nP.45\n\n3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.\nThis is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set\nin this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between\nSoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the\ninterstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46\n\n4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a\ndelivery/receipt at Ferc.\n\n5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage\ncapacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current\nlevel 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current\nstorage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs\nproposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.\n52 &54.\n\n6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share\nof non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58\n\n7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore\ndefault balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using\nthis service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62\n\n8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a\nproposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I\nsee only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63\n\n9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures\nassociated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO\nimpact on TW. P.66\n\n10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by\nbundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct\nimpact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore\ninterest. P. 75\n\n11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective\nthe adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core\nITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on\nTW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an\nadditional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an\nestimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be\napprox. $ 44.4 Million.\n\n12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4\ncents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.\n\n13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.\nNo impact on TW. P.85-87\n\n14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP\nmarket rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO\nimpact on TW interest. P 88-100.\n\n15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to\nservices envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already\nstarted to \"implement\" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a\nbalancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the\nPD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.\n\n\nOn whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.\nThe SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with \"SoCal backbone\nfacilities\". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is\nrecognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a\npreference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW\ndeliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do\nnot impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to\nsupport the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators\nwith additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore\ncustomers with additional cost allocations.\n\n\nPoints for comments\n\n1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied\nin the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal\nmarket structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to\nbuild long term supply and transportation contracts.\n\n2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market\ninefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants\nwith gas scheduling certainty.\n\n3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system\nwill promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.\n\n4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves\nupon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work \"relatively well\" during\nCalifornia's challenging energy markets.\n\n5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets\nin California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising\noptions are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already\nstarting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the\noperating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow\nthrough and make the structural changes required to make permanent these\nimprovements.\n\n6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,\nTW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,\nPRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)\n\n\nI look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.\n\nMark, IGS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark, IGS.","To":["glen.hass@enron.com"],"cont_length":1332,"Week_number":"41","Date":"Wed, 17 Oct 2001 14:21:31 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<14118488.1075851626410.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR"},{"content":"DWR can meet with us on October 22nd.

It does qualify this statement by discussing where potential bottlenecks in delivery might occur and recommends actions to address the bottlenecks.  See below for a link to the report.\n\nMary Schoen \nEnvironmental Strategies \nEnron Corp \n415.782.7803 (phone) \n415.782.7854 (fax) \n\n\nFor immediate release: October 3, 2001 \nContact: Claudia Chandler : 916-654-4989 \n\nEnergy Commission Report Projects \nImproved Natural Gas Supplies For the State \n\n\n\nSacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.\n\nThe Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified \"yes\" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.\n\nNearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.\n\nThe newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.\n\n\"This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future,\" said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.\n\nTo help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.\n\nNatural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.\n\nThe just adopted Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report can be found on the Energy Commission's Web Site at: \n\n\nwww.energy.ca.gov/contracts <<http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts>> \n\n\nOr report is attached: \n\n << File: Gas Infrastructure Report.pdf >>","To":["m..landwehr@enron.com"],"cont_length":817,"Week_number":"41","Date":"Thu, 18 Oct 2001 07:16:40 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<20041834.1075852589513.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: CEC Report on Natural Gas Supplies Adopted"},{"content":"Speech apparently was not quite as sharp as recent ones, but heard the event overall was very good.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMara, Susan  \nSent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 9:46 AM\nTo:\tLandwehr, Susan M.\nCc:\tDasovich, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: W speech\n\nWe didn't go.

I\nknow the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of\nHonduras. I hope to provide you with a more deailed answer after consulting\nreliable travel guides and weather almanacs. \n\nQuestion 3: The diving is supposed to be quite \"killer\" (as you put it).

The energy markets\nin California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising\noptions are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already\nstarting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the\noperating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow\nthrough and make the structural changes required to make permanent these\nimprovements.\n\n6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD.

Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. \n\nApproximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.\n\nHere's some individual comments: \n\nCatherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to \"help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record\".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.\n\nSam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.\n\nArnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying \"show me\" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  \n\nRory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. \n\nCarl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.\n\nGlen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  \n\nJudy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.\n\nEd GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said \"FERC--just get it done\"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.\n\nOther Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.\n\n\nFrom the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the \"there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...\"\n\n\nCall me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.

At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. \n\n\"Circumstances have changed,\" said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. \"Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market.\" \n\nEarlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, \n\nand Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. \n\nBut the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. \n\nIt is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. \n\nAt the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. \n\nAdministration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. \n\nThe PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. \n\n\"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis,\" Angelides said yesterday. \n\nHe urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. \n\nBut Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. \n\nShe also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.","To":["susan.mara@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com"],"cont_length":557,"Week_number":"41","Date":"Sat, 20 Oct 2001 08:49:22 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<22109914.1075852588774.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"State lowers estimate of energy costs (See DA suspension debate)"},{"content":"State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter\n\n\nEnergy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.\n\nBy MIGUEL BUSTILLO\nTimes Staff Writer\n\nOctober 20 2001\n\nSACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. \n\nEven so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. \n\nThe discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. \n\nSpecifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. \n\nLynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. \n\nCalifornia has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. \n\nIn August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. \n\nBut in what consumer groups angrily called a \"jailbreak,\" Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. \n\nBig Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers\n\nThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. \n\nHowever, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. \n\n\"Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,\" said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. \"Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers.\" \n\nState Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the \"stampede\" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. \n\n\"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis,\" Angelides said. \n\nAnd consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. \n\n\"The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,\" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. \"Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place.\" \n\nBut Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. \n\nLynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. \n\nThe real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. \n\n\"If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,\" Lynch said. \"The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts.\" \n\nAlso adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. \n\nThe loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. \n\nDavis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy\n\nIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. \n\nIf the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. \n\nIn another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. \n\nBut Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. \n\n\"I don't think it's real smart to tell you that,\" said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.","To":["susan.mara@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","david.delainey@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","lamar.frazier@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","mike.smith@enron.com","evan.hughes@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","m..landwehr@enron.com","sarah.novosel@enron.com","ray.alvarez@enron.com"],"cont_length":1278,"Week_number":"41","Date":"Sat, 20 Oct 2001 09:00:37 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<25851424.1075852588750.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Davis, Lynch, Angelides fight over contracts and Direct Access suspension"},{"content":"Sorry.

SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at\nEnron\n\nBy Stephen Taub\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide\ninformation regarding certain related party transactions. \n\n\"We welcome this request,\" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a\nprepared statement. \"We will cooperate fully with the SEC.\" \n\nEnron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and\nelectricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys\nreviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and\napproved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC\nfilings. \"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in\nconnection with these transactions was considered and done,\" Lay added. \n\nAs we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial\nofficer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits\nfrom transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall\nStreet Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals\nwith Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk\nof losses. \n\n\nREPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED\nLater this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was\nnearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial\nTimes. \n\nSpecifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues\nrose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues\nclimbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. \n\nThe reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of\nits business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the\nfirst half of this year. \n\n\"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period\nof great challenge and change in our profession,\" chairman James Turley told\nthe FT. \n\nRival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year\nthrough August 31. \n\nAnother reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm\nis expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local\ncurrency terms, according to the paper. \n\nTurley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and\nare instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt\ncovenant issues, and security concerns. \"We're going to see more covenant\nviolations and that will drive restructuring issues,\" Turley told the FT. \n\nRead On!

Other than skepticism \nfrom legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority \nescaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and \nfuel cells at [18]. \n[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority \n(from [1]) \nIs the California Power Authority a dangerously \nout-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting \nback some state control over electricity supplies? \nThe Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the \nPower Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter \nand spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. \nThe move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember \nFred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair \nof the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob \nHertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal \nauthors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, \nSBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the \nEnergy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping \nthe Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly \nthe RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, \nCapstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy \nFoundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps \nbetween Capstone and the Energy Foundation. \nPolitical maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer \nPower and Conservation Financing Authority. \nNot only elected officials are concerned; the staff and \nheads of other agencies the Power Authority must \nwork with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose \nPower Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector \nof the Department of Water Resources rebuffed \nPower Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal \nto have it buy peaker output. California Energy \nCommission members said they are at policy odds \nwith the Power Authority's siting plans. \nIn an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said \nthat the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil \npeakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not \nable to respond quickly enough to balancing power \nneeds. \"The letters of intent already approved by the \nPower Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb \nthat power given the outlook for net-short need.\" \nFreeman assumes that the market for Power Authority \npower will be via contract, not the spot market. \"Selling \non the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,\" said \nPower Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. \nThe Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently \nin the position of actually being able to acquire \nnew energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to \nunderwrite continued DWR power purchases is in \nlimbo and the California Independent System Operator \nis still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority \ncannot issue bonds until it has its own economic \nhouse in order, and an Assembly investigation might \njeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. \n[","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","sarah.novosel@enron.com","m..landwehr@enron.com","janel.guerrero@enron.com","sue.nord@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","f..calger@enron.com","david.parquet@enron.com","laird.dyer@enron.com","michael.mcdonald@enron.com","barry.tycholiz@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com"],"cont_length":536,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 11:17:24 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<12356800.1075851627440.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"CA Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash"},{"content":"10-ish percent.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dorothy Rothrock [mailto:drothrock@cmta.net]\nSent: Monday, October 22, 2001 12:32 PM\nTo: Dasovich, Jeff\nSubject: Re: Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L.

SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at\nEnron\n\nBy Stephen Taub\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide\ninformation regarding certain related party transactions. \n\n\"We welcome this request,\" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a\nprepared statement. \"We will cooperate fully with the SEC.\" \n\nEnron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and\nelectricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys\nreviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and\napproved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC\nfilings. \"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in\nconnection with these transactions was considered and done,\" Lay added. \n\nAs we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial\nofficer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits\nfrom transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall\nStreet Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals\nwith Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk\nof losses. \n\n\nREPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED\nLater this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was\nnearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial\nTimes. \n\nSpecifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues\nrose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues\nclimbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. \n\nThe reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of\nits business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the\nfirst half of this year. \n\n\"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period\nof great challenge and change in our profession,\" chairman James Turley told\nthe FT. \n\nRival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year\nthrough August 31. \n\nAnother reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm\nis expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local\ncurrency terms, according to the paper. \n\nTurley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and\nare instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt\ncovenant issues, and security concerns. \"We're going to see more covenant\nviolations and that will drive restructuring issues,\" Turley told the FT. \n\nRead On!

Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date\n\nI'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to \"homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises...\"  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.\n\nThe concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  \n\nTo her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.\n\nIn light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:\n\nAngelides is all wet--DA and \"fairness\" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.\nRe-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.\n\nFolks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  \n\nA letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.\n\nAny thoughts?  \n\nBest,\nJeff","To":["d..steffes@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com"],"cont_length":446,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 11:52:32 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<5591277.1075851627583.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"FW: Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L.

The overall result is to\nreduce\nthe capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3\nmillion.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in\nelectric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing.\nListed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.\n\n1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in\nessence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much\nit\ninvested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a\n1998\nforecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year\nforecast.\nTURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this\namount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the\nend\nof 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the\nCommission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted\namount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The\nrehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the\nelectric\ndistribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject\nto\nrefund.\n\n2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric\ndistribution\ncapital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.\n\n3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was\nreduced by $9.2 million.\n\n4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to\njustify\nthe large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated\nthat\nPG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed\namount\nby $7.9 million.\n\n5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had\nfailed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA\ncustomers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that\nmoney was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had\ndisallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission\ndisallowed $20 million.\n\n6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2\nmillion as\nfunds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which\nthey\nhad not received any benefits.","To":["mona.l.petrochko@enron.com"],"cont_length":508,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 12:05:09 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<20199001.1075851627607.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Rehearing on PG&E's GRC"},{"content":"I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.

Too bad Mr. Davis is finding he still can't avoid his own chickens co=\r\nming home to roost.=20\r\nOnly now are the folks in Sacramento learning that their Governor's \"soluti=\r\non\" to the energy crisis has been a political sham. A combination of collap=\r\nsing budget revenues, foolish spending and bad credit ratings threatens to =\r\nplunge the state into a full-fledged financial crisis.\r\nGovernor Davis's chickens left the roost back in May 2000, when California'=\r\ns botched scheme to deregulate electric power encountered a wicked price bu=\r\nbble. Wholesale prices, which had been deregulated, shot up, while retail p=\r\nrices, which were still regulated, didn't budge. This mismatch, along with =\r\nother factors, generated huge supply disruptions and a first-class energy c=\r\nrisis.=20\r\nThe obvious response would have been to let retail rates rise with the mark=\r\net price. Mr. Davis said so himself in his now infamous observation that if=\r\n he raised rates, the problem would be solved in 20 minutes. Mr. Davis pref=\r\nerred to play the blame game, including a lot of whining that he had inheri=\r\nted the situation.=20\r\nWhile the Governor complained, California's two largest utilities were push=\r\ned into insolvency and neighboring states endured the double whammy of havi=\r\nng their power sucked into California and seeing their electric rates shoot=\r\n up. Californians suffered through rolling blackouts.=20\r\nFinally, this past January -- eight months after the energy crisis began --=\r\n the Governor responded: Retail rates were increased twice, and the state s=\r\ntarted to purchase power directly from suppliers, using money from its gene=\r\nral fund. At the same time, the state negotiated contracts with suppliers a=\r\nt prices that are now well above market prices and for terms as long as 20 =\r\nyears.=20\r\nAnd then Mr. Davis got lucky. Although the forecast was for a summer of con=\r\ntinued blackouts generated by a strong demand for power, the disaster faile=\r\nd to materialize. Not only was the weather cooler than normal, but higher r=\r\nates produced immediate conservation; thus demand was moderate and power su=\r\nfficient. Newsweek went out and hailed the Governor as a political Lazarus.=\r\n=20\r\nBut now here come the chickens. It seems that almost one-quarter of Califor=\r\nnia's budget revenues were provided by taxpayers with stock options and cap=\r\nital gains, mostly from Silicon Valley companies. When the dot-com industry=\r\n started to implode, so did revenue projections -- to $12 billion this year=\r\n, down from $18 billion last year. And this was before September 11 and the=\r\n collapse in the Nasdaq market.=20\r\nCalifornia would probably be able to absorb this revenue hit were it not fo=\r\nr the still outstanding bills from the Governor's electric power fiasco. Co=\r\nnsider the toll:=20\r\n-- Somebody is going to have to pay for the $14 billion that the utilities =\r\nowe to suppliers for power consumed before the state started buying electri=\r\ncity.=20\r\n-- Somebody is going to have to repay the $12.5 billion bond issue that Cal=\r\nifornia hopes to float to replenish the money borrowed from its general fun=\r\nd.=20\r\n-- Somebody is going to have to pay for those expensive, long-term contract=\r\ns that the state negotiated.=20\r\n-- Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of $4.3 billion that =\r\nCalifornia got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering. (If t=\r\nhis loan is not repaid by November 1, its interest rate jumps to 7% from 4%=\r\n, resulting in an extra $250,000 in interest payments a day.)=20\r\nWhether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers, or s=\r\nome combination of the two, the impact on California's economy and its budg=\r\net will be dreadful.

No hand-outs were provided.\n\nCalculation of Receipt Point Capacity\nTopock  540 mmcf/d\nEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/d\nNeedles 800 mmcf/d\nWheeler 800 mmcf/d\n\nNew Receipt Points\nKramer Junction 200 mmcf/d\nHector Rd 50 mmcf/d\nBoth will be available around Feb 1\n\nBasis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation\nCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.\n\nNew Calculation, Changes and Display\nBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.\n\nOFO Declaration\nName changes from overnomination\nCan declare before any Cycle\nProvide 2 hour notice\nPost on Gas Select\nShow OFO Calculation on Gas Select\n\nWindows\nReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system\nCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   \nDue to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  \nReplace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's\nNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.\n\nScheduling Changes-Nov 1\nGas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     \nRollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle\nCopy confirmed noms\nAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.\n\n2 Hour Notice\nSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.\nOFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  \n\nScheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO\nNominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  \nExpected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.\nNo interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.\nUse Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules\nExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.\nFlow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  \nIf call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.\nMany people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  \nIf OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:\n\nCycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut\nCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut\nCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut\nWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  \nFor OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.\n\nFor an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:\n\n         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes\nCycle 1                                    Cycle 2\nCycle 2                                     Intraday 1\nCycle 3\t\t\t\tevening cyle 2 on 10/4\nCycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4\n\nIn other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.\n\nWinter Balancing Rules\nEffective Nov 1-March 31\nNo changes.\nAll customers must comply.\nMinimum delivery requirements\n50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)\n70% of daily usage depending on storage level\n70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min\n90% of daily usage depending on storage level\n90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.\nLook at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.\nMust increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.\nOnce 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,\n\nContracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.\n\nCore Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  \nCore-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)\nNot subject to 70% and 90% rules.\n\n2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.\n\nBurn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,\nMin DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.\n\nCustomer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.\n\n\nOFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)","To":["m..tholt@enron.com"],"cont_length":1307,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 14:27:42 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<27403451.1075851627958.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Socal Window Meeting"},{"content":"can you email the most recent version of the QF buy-out presentation?

He will start in his new position in early November. \nThe authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . \nBerry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. \nBerry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. \nBerry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. \nFrom 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. \nHe also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. \nIn his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually. \nCalls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time.","To":["mendelso@haas.berkeley.edu"],"cont_length":375,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Tue, 23 Oct 2001 08:32:00 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<28669069.1075851628147.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Greetings:  You know this fellow?"},{"content":"Tom:\nHere's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow.  \nIf you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at 415.782.7822. \nWhat number should I call you at tomorrow? \n  \nBest,\nJeff","To":["tomb@crossborderenergy.com"],"cont_length":41,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Tue, 23 Oct 2001 08:40:38 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<32963535.1075851628169.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"QF Presentation"},{"content":"at the all-employee meeting, someone just asked Lay if he was on crack.  broke the place up. jeff","To":["7409949@skytel.com","9069876@skytel.com"],"cont_length":19,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Tue, 23 Oct 2001 08:52:14 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<921482.1075851628192.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Oh, great.

After reviewing your presentation,\nhere are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:\n\n1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under\ncontracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy\nreplaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed\nQF power with short-term firm energy?\n\nWOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE \"DISPATCHABLE.\"\n\n2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it\nhas substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market\nenergy from sources over which it may have less control?\nPRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.)  IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING.\n\n3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in\nCalifornia, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep\nis the supply curve for replacement energy?\n\nFORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE.  HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED.\n\n4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the\nelectric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide\non-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?\n\nYES.\n\n5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes\nin the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?\n\nOBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED.\n\n6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF\ncontract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when\nthe same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as\nthe QF buyouts done to date)?\n\nBILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST.  THEY ARE A MYTH.  THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE.\n\n7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power\nprocurement business?  If not, why not?\n\nTHAT'S A GOOD THING.  AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS.\n\nAs you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time\nfor such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.\n\nTHERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.  AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF.  LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.\n\nTalk to you tomorrow,\n\nTom\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff <Jeff.Dasovich@ENRON.com>\nTo: tomb@crossborderenergy.com <tomb@crossborderenergy.com>\nDate: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 8:41 AM\nSubject: QF Presentation\n\n\n\nTom:\nHere's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow.\nIf you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at\n415.782.7822.\nWhat number should I call you at tomorrow?\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n>  <<QF Auction General.ppt>>\n>\n>\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\nmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\nintended recipient (s).

After reviewing your presentation,\nhere are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:\n\n1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under\ncontracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy\nreplaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed\nQF power with short-term firm energy?\n\n2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it\nhas substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market\nenergy from sources over which it may have less control?\n\n3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in\nCalifornia, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep\nis the supply curve for replacement energy?\n\n4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the\nelectric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide\non-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?\n\n5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes\nin the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?\n\n6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF\ncontract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when\nthe same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as\nthe QF buyouts done to date)?\n\n7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power\nprocurement business?  If not, why not?\n\nAs you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time\nfor such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.\n\nTalk to you tomorrow,\n\nTom\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff <Jeff.Dasovich@ENRON.com>\nTo: tomb@crossborderenergy.com <tomb@crossborderenergy.com>\nDate: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 8:41 AM\nSubject: QF Presentation\n\n\n\nTom:\nHere's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow.\nIf you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at\n415.782.7822.\nWhat number should I call you at tomorrow?\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n>  <<QF Auction General.ppt>>\n>\n>\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\nmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\nintended recipient (s).

They are wanting to discuss completely different issues than PG&E   To date, PG&E issues have been focused around the outcome of the FERC refund case. I have worked through a couple of examples of this under collection issue with Jeff and we agree, Edison's  argument  that the DA load contributed to the under collection is \"technically\" correct.   We will have to work with Jeff to build a compelling argument that ESP's should not be required to continue to contribute to the under collection, especially as of March 31, 2002, the end of the rate freeze as required in AB 1890.   Somehow we have to convince \"the regulators\"  that the original intent of the de-reg bill, that utilities recover what they can through no later than March, 02,  stay in place for the current DA load.  \n\nWill keep you posted. \n\nWanda\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDasovich, Jeff  \nSent:\tTuesday, October  23, 2001 5:02 PM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael; Sanders, Richard B.; Kean, Steven J.; Sharp, Vicki; Smith, Mike; Williams, Robert C.; Curry, Wanda; Swain, Steve; Huddleson, Diann; Calger, Christopher F.; Belden, Tim; Dietrich, Janet\nSubject:\tConversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid\n\nI talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk.

Guess we do have to worry about that.   I was thinking it would apply to our receivable, not the total under collection, but that would not make sense.  Maybe the other idea will work.

That's my biggest concern.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:\n\nThey plan to \"settle\" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.\nEdison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.\nHe said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.\nIn addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)\nI recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.\nHe said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison \"meet and confer\" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.\nFielder is also the point person on \"getting ESPs paid\" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.\nIt was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.\n\nIf you have any questions, let us know.\n\nBest,\nJeff","To":["c..williams@enron.com"],"cont_length":572,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 10:25:55 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<8277138.1075851629168.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid"},{"content":"u get message from tribolet. re: px credit call at 4 pm (CDT)? jeff","To":["9069876@skytel.com"],"cont_length":14,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 10:50:50 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<30742255.1075851629191.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Thanks.

Gray Davis, the department said. \n\nIn a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. \n\nSuch sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. \n\nThe DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. \n\nAccording to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. \n\nThe state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. \n\nDavis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. \n\nThe DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. \n\nThe DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.","To":["jeff.dasovich@enron.com"],"cont_length":380,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 14:22:37 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<25362996.1075851629332.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter"},{"content":"Nice presentation.

As CFO.com reported in a\nstory earlier this week, Fastow's role in a limited partnership has raised\nconcerns about a conflict of interest. \n\nFastow is succeeded by Jeff McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and\nCEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was\nEnron's treasurer. He resigned that post in part because he disapproved of\nFastow's role in running two partnerships, according to The Wall Street\nJournal. \n\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear\nto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as\nCFO,\" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO, in a statement. \n\nMcMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office\nas CFO for the company's European operations. Upon returning to the United\nStates, McMahon assumed the post of EVP of finance and treasurer for Enron\nCorp. In 2000, he was named president and COO of Enron Net Works, where he\nfocused on E-commerce activities. \n\nAs reported on Friday, The Wall Street Journal said a limited partnership\norganized by Fastow, who has been Enron's CFO since 1997, racked up millions\nof dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company. \n\nOn Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested\ninformation regarding certain related party transactions. \n\nOn October 16, Enron stunned Wall Street when it announced that it would\ntake a $1.01 billion after-tax charge for the September 30 quarter. \n\nSince the announcement, Enron's share price has more than halved. \n\nFastow's dismissal seems to be an about-face for Enron. In a conference call\nTuesday, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to\nassure that there was no conflict as Fastow played both roles. Enron has\nsince dissolved the partnerships. \n\n\"Obviously, the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there\nwould be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed\ncertain methods for it to be dealt with ... so Enron would never be\ncompromised,\" Lay said in published accounts. \"We are very concerned [at]\nthe way Andy's character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles,\nas well as the company's reputation.\" \n\nPredictably, on Wednesday at least two law firms - Stull, Stull & Brody and\nBernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, L.L.P - filed class-action suits against\nEnron, Lay, Fastow, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief\nexecutive who resigned in August. \n\nThe suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information\nthat materially misstated the company's condition and prospects to the\ninvesting public. Moreover, the suits argue that the company failed to\ndisclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not\nmisleading. \n\nThe complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning\nits business, financial results, and operations which failed to disclose,\namong other things: \n\n* The company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining\ndemand for bandwidth, and the company's efforts to create a trading market\nfor bandwidth were not meeting with success, as many of the market\nparticipants were not creditworthy. \n\n* The company's operating results were materially overstated, since Enron\nfailed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with\ncertain limited partnerships - the partnerships that were managed by Fastow.\n\n\n* Enron was failing to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in\naccordance with GAAP. \n\nRead On!

Is that something--\n\n              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,\n              something...\n\n              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?\n\n              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward\n              thinking.\n\n              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited\n              partnership transactions of Mr.--\n\n              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking\n              about.\n\n              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an\n              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a\n              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one\n              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly\n              what was happening with the electricity market which then\n              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer\n              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?\n\n              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's\n              yesterday's trading--\n\n              Haines:  Wait a minute.\n\n              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.\n              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that\n              Fastow, after four--\n\n              Faber:  Late yesterday.\n\n              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's\n              interesting--\n\n              Faber:  He's the CFO--\n\n              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.\n\n              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these\n              off balance sheet partnerships.\n\n              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not\n              on thin ice.\n\n              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this\n              is your theory.\n\n              Cramer:  This is my theory.\n\n              Haines:  OK.\n\n              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I\n              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze\n              that occurred.\n\n              Haines:  OK.\n\n              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.\n\n              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for\n              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that\n              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements\n              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now\n              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market\n              down.\n\n              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come\n              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and\n              those who've left the company as investors over this last\n              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent\n              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to\n              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their\n              investors, they need to come clean with their trading\n              counterparties because that is really what people are\n              concerned about.\n\n              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big\n              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit\n              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go\n              down, how would that affect energy trading?\n\n              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be\n              there on the other side and make good on the trades.\n\n              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?\n\n              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if\n              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,\n              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.\n\n              Kernen:  Now, why would--\n\n              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.\n\n              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from\n              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?\n              Because of something that could unravel--\n\n              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities\n              they may have--\n\n              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.\n\n              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of\n              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped\n              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at\n              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?\n              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--\n\n              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?\n\n              Faber:  They don't know.\n\n              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited\n              partners?\n\n              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is\n              what some analysts estimated.\n\n              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.\n\n              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets\n              that they have in the partnerships themselves.\n\n              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened\n              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if\n              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high\n              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.\n\n              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got\n              hurt.\n\n              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.\n\n              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.\n\n              Kernen:  You are.\n\n              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.\n\n              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know\n              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the\n              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation\n              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have\n              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this\n              chart?  We're breaking below the--\n\n              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.\n\n              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?\n\n              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!\n\n              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting\n              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you\n              going down to Houston yourself?\n\n              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that\n              whole city.\n\n              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down\n              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back\n              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are\n              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?\n\n              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going\n              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing\n              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much\n              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the\n              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much\n              stronger than before.\n\n              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about\n              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I\n              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at\n              this point.  That's a long way.\n\n              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but\n              I still think that--\n\n              Kernen:  It's no longer the--\n\n              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety\n              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.\n\n                        # # #","To":["laird.dyer@enron.com"],"cont_length":1376,"Week_number":"42","Date":"Thu, 25 Oct 2001 14:15:09 -0700 (PDT)","Message-ID":"<31232845.1075851630128.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Cramer on Enron"},{"content":"Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.

Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. \nBut the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. \n\"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?\" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. \nAnd many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. \n\"Good luck!\" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. \nDavis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. \nThe outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. \n\"This could save billions of dollars,\" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. \nBarry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is \"not targeting every contract\" because the pacts have been \"extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.\" \nThe governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. \nThe governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. \nThe state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. \nThough the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. \nThe long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. \nThe liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing \"perfect storm\" of fiscal calamities. \nThe state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. \nThe standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. \nBurton has called \"for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.\" \nThe deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. \nWithout the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. \nThe projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. \nAgainst the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. \nBut some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. \nThe Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. \n\"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'\" said Calpine's Cartwright. \nIf state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be \"very, very severe,\" but also \"they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,\" Cartwright said. \nHis comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. \nHeller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis \"is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.\" \n\"Last spring,\" Heller said, \"power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.\"","To":["f..calger@enron.com","tim.belden@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","jeff.richter@enron.com","david.parquet@enron.com","pat.shortridge@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","linda.robertson@enron.com","michael.mcdonald@enron.com","barry.tycholiz@enron.com"],"cont_length":1040,"Week_number":"43","Date":"Mon, 29 Oct 2001 13:23:41 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<19202929.1075851630758.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Governor wants to cut costs of power"},{"content":"You folks giving this to the press?

I should have sent it to you also.\n\n     I hope that things are going well with you.\n\n     I'm trying to assess the emissions impact of increased Back-Up\n     Generator (BUG) diesel fuel use from 2000 to 2001.  I need real data\n     to support an effort to get state funds to help mitigate the\n     additional emissions in the Bay Area.  This is NOT for compliance,\n     enforcement, or rulemaking, etc. purposes.  I could use your help.\n\n     I would need 2000 and 2001 data for diesel fuel use or hours of BUG\n     operation:\n\n     BUG engine, hp, fuel use 2000 and 2001 to date.  One comparison might\n     be 10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.\n\n     We want to verify, if it is true, that business and industry felt\n     compelled by the energy situation to operate their diesel BUGs more\n     hours and burn more fuel (fuel readiness testing and emergency backup\n     power) than in past comparable periods.\n\n     I was hoping that you could provide some actual use data for the\n     back-up diesel engines at your SVMG member companies.  I would need\n     specific engine information as indicated above.  The data information\n     can be as simple as total diesel fuel use for the first 9 months of\n     2000 versus the first 9 mos. of 2001.  Ideally, we would prefer\n     10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.\n\n     I'm seeking this information at your earliest convenience (by the end\n     of the day Wednesday).  Please telephone or e-mail me if you have any\n     questions.  My apologies for this short notice (I did send in an\n     inquiry to Justin on 10/22/01).

She asked me to stay on board on an hourly, as-needed basis while they try to figure out what will happen next year.  Although I don't expect much work, it's certainly better than being cut out completely and she mentioned that you had appreciated my help during the contempt negotiations.  \n \nI don't envy Karen for her job at the moment.  I've been getting the clips and Houston doesn't look like a fun place to be right now.  I also don't think they're planning too far in advance.  Yikes!\n \nI've got a couple of CPUC questions for you.  What's the process for making a presentation in regard to either a specific case on the agenda?  Is it simply a matter of being present during a public hearing, or is there a list of witnesses/commentors that you have to get on?  The reason I ask is that I've been approached by a potential client regarding some telecommunications/broadband issues, with an appearance at the CPUC as a news hook.\n \nHow far in advance is the meeting agenda set?  I noticed that a meeting is scheduled for Nov. 29, but an agenda was not available on the Web site.  Is it likely that it is still being compiled?  How do you get on the agenda?\n \nAny light you can shed on this for me would be appreciated.  I don't know if this project is going to come through or not, but I'm not sure my possible client is any better versed on CPUC procedures than I am.  I figure at least one of us should know what we're talking about.\n \nThanks!  You might give me a heads up if there's anything on one of the upcoming Wednesday calls that you'd like me to comment on.

While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. \nAccording to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. \n\"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace,\" said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. \nSwezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. \nThe study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. \n\"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack,\" said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. \nCALIFORNIA CAVEAT \nGreen power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . \nBut in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. \n\"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth,\" Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. \nMore than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. \nNon-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. \nWith the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade. \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel. \nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .","To":["vjw@greenpower.org"],"cont_length":488,"Week_number":"43","Date":"Fri, 2 Nov 2001 14:29:07 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<26439963.1075859200930.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Go Green Choice"},{"content":"Hey, you guys having fun yet?

I am comfortable taking the lead from Enron on this issue and would support not advocating it be included in this case.  I think SCE is going to push for its inclusion, so Sue will need to provide you with some amunition on why it doesn't belong in this case before Wednesday.\n \nOn the second question, no.  I don't think we want to re-raise the rev req and tres letter leading to the end of DA.\n \nI not sure we should push the bottoms up issue in this case.  It is not at all clear what the ALJ is trying to pull into the case with the reference to post px credits.  There is no pending matters on this, but for advice letters and protests.  We are much better fighting in that forum given the current decisions rather than getting some nasty decision from Barnett that messes up the victory we got in the rate increase decisions.\n \nI strongly urge that we NOT push this into this proceeding.  It will be all downside.  Changes to the PE Credit (i.e. reductions) may end up here, but we should not be calling for it.\n \nLastly, how can we say that the commission doesn't have authority to implement exit fees without changes in law given prior filings of ARM that said they should implement a whole host of exit fees rather than end DA.  I don't think we can take this position without explaining the flip flop, which we certainly don't have room to do in the PHC statement.  Maybe we can get away with referencing other parties strong position on this and support the requirement of hearings if any such attempt is going to be made to establish exit fees.\n \nThanks\n \nAaron\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dan Douglass [mailto:douglass@energyattorney.com]\nSent: Monday, November 05, 2001 12:47 PM\nTo: ARM\nSubject: Prehearing Conference Statement - COMMENTS NEEDED\nImportance: High\n\n\nAttached for your review and comment is a very rough first draft of the prehearing conference statement that we must bring to the hearing on Wednesday afternoon.

Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.\n\nSeems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.\nAssuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.\nIt would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.\nIn a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.\nBut it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).\nBut if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.\n\nAgain, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.

(Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)\nThe judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).\nOur attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  \nThough the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.\nInterestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  \nThe judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  \nAs a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.\nThe judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., \"why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info,\" etc.\nFrom today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  \nIn related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in \"serious negotitations.\"","To":["jeremy.blachman@enron.com","susan.mara@enron.com","d..steffes@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","j..kean@enron.com","paul.kaufman@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","evan.hughes@enron.com","vicki.sharp@enron.com","c..williams@enron.com","janet.dietrich@enron.com","diann.huddleson@enron.com","mike.smith@enron.com","lamar.frazier@enron.com","michael.tribolet@enron.com","lisa.mellencamp@enron.com","wanda.curry@enron.com","steve.swain@enron.com"],"cont_length":565,"Week_number":"44","Date":"Wed, 7 Nov 2001 17:23:15 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<4157665.1075859202205.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Update on California PUC Hearing--DA Suspension Implementation; Exit Fees; PX Credit, etc.--11.07.01"},{"content":"interesting to say the least.  great case for b-school.  you still in texas?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Joan.Wagner@bus.utexas.edu [mailto:Joan.Wagner@bus.utexas.edu]\nSent: Thursday, November 08, 2001 10:02 AM\nTo: Jeff_Dasovich@enron.com\nSubject: Merger?\n\n\n\nIneteresting times at Enron.

I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing\n \nThe (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a \"reasonable\" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.\n \nAt the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.\n \nI hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.

Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.\nFor the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.\nBy contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.\nIn short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.\nWe are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.\nTherefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a \"special case\" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.\n\nThanks for listening.

Parties have until,\nWednesday, November 28th, to comment.\n\nThe following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek\nCommission approval:\n\n1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP\nList submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.\n\n2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service\nAgreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,\nthey must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,\n2001.\n\n3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer\naccount, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party\nverification took place prior to September 20, 2001.\n\n4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after\nSeptember 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place\non or before Sept. 20th.\n\n5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.\n\n6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still\nunder a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to\nprocess DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.\n\n\n7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a\nmerger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;\nrequests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if\nthe new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.\n\n8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a\ncustomer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).\n\n9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights\nto another.\n\n10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a\ncommunity aggregation program after the suspension date should not be\nallowed.\n\nIn addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for\nimplementing the suspension.\n\n1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and\naccepted).\n\n2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should\nrequire that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off\nto submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the\nCommission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to\nreceive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay\nfrom the Commission.\n\n3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was\nassociated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set\nforth a proposed affidavit.)\n\nIf you have any questions, please call\n\nJeanne","To":["d..steffes@enron.com","b.smith@enron.com"],"cont_length":597,"Week_number":"46","Date":"Mon, 19 Nov 2001 09:29:38 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<23019628.1075859203907.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: Implementation of the Suspension Direct Access -- UDCs' Plan"},{"content":"Not all, but some.

The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical.\n \n2.    If we got this \"gift\", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.\n \nHaving said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dasovich, Jeff \nSent: Friday, November 16, 2001 7:35 PM\nTo: Parquet, David; Wehn, Samuel\nSubject: FW: Water\n\n\nYou guys interested?\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Scott Govenar \nSent: Fri 11/16/2001 5:43 PM \nTo: Jeff Dasovich; Susan J Mara \nCc: \nSubject: Water\n\n\n\nAssembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would\ngrant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using\nreclaimed water.

Elena tells me that you're having a great time.\n\n\tThanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.\tWe're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  \n\n\tIn sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.\n\nHere are some of the program's highlights:\n\nEnabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.\n\nOur alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name. \n\nOur market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities\n\nOur alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.\n\nProducts and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.\n\nInnovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses. \n\n\tThanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.\n\nAll the best,\nJeff","To":["janelle.scheuer@enron.com"],"cont_length":359,"Week_number":"47","Date":"Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:18:05 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<5695107.1075859205135.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"Anaheim"},{"content":"and we ate more last night and we're still alive.

We'll\nhave mostly MBA students from Haas, but also about a dozen masters\nstudents from ERG. There are also usually at least a few PhD students.\nThe students in the class are were very smart -- many of them\nalready have experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the\ncourse puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any\nenergy-related organization that they would join.  You can see a copy of\nlast year's course syllabus at\n http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste/EnergyMarketsSyllabus.pdf\n\nMany of these students are interested in either summer or permanent\nemployment starting as early as May.  If you have openings that you would\nlike to advertise to these students, please let me know.  We will be\nsetting up a webpage with job announcements in energy-related\norganizations.  If you send me a job description (or the URL for it), I\ncan add it to the webpage.\n\nTalk to you soon,\nSeverin\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSeverin Borenstein\n\nE.T.

I am as grateful as one can be.  Like many of you=\r\n, I loved this place and feel an immense sense of loss at what is occurring=\r\n.  My heart also aches for the financial losses that so many have suffered,=\r\n not only in our group, but also throughout the company, particularly given=\r\n how much all of us have given to this place, some for many years.  I have =\r\nbeen searching for a way to capture what we've done here and was reading a =\r\nbook the other day about Teddy Roosevelt, former President of the United St=\r\nates, and saw a quote that I thought was appropriate to our group and circu=\r\nmstances?the quote is,=20\r\n\r\n\"the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena?who strives =\r\nvaliantly, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends =\r\nhimself in worthy causes.  Who, at best, knows the triumph of high achievem=\r\nent and who, at worst, if he fails, fails while daring greatly so that his =\r\nplace shall never be with those cold and timid souls, who knew neither vict=\r\nory nor defeat.\"\r\n\r\nThe work that we did here was great.  The way we did it, I believe, sets an=\r\n example for those who will attempt to fill our shoes?and we fought for the=\r\n right cause, i.e., competitive markets around the world.  Our victories we=\r\nre many and often directly due to our presence and leadership?the failure t=\r\nhat we are experiencing as a company, however, that is so deep and so thoro=\r\nugh, was not of our making.  I don't know exactly what the days and weeks a=\r\nhead hold for any of us, but I am quite confident that the good work that w=\r\ne do and the way that we do it, and the sense of community that we were abl=\r\ne to create in this group, will show up in new places and new companies all=\r\n around the world over the next months and years.  I hope to speak to many,=\r\n if not all of you, on a one to one basis over the next several weeks to ex=\r\npress my thanks and gratitude for having had the opportunity to work with y=\r\nou, but I also want to take this opportunity to wish each of you the best i=\r\nn the future and during this holiday season.\r\n\r\nThank you","To":["richard.shapiro@enron.com"],"cont_length":807,"Week_number":"47","Date":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 16:36:21 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<14536830.1075859205896.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":"RE: My Thoughts"},{"content":"should i stop working?  no big deal, really.  but don't want to continue, if it doesn't make sense.  thanks, jeff","To":["9069876@skytel.com"],"cont_length":22,"Week_number":"48","Date":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 10:37:01 -0800 (PST)","Message-ID":"<10698025.1075859205975.JavaMail.evans@thyme>","Subject":""},{"content":"Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie.
